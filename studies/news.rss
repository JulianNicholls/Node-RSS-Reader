<title>Should I use WKWebView or SFSafariViewController for web views in my app?</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=trjs0tcd</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=trjs0tcd</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/FBE081E9-D688-4C9C-A051-8E0E4E68EE3D/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether your app needs to provide a full web browsing experience, display richly-styled content, or incorporate external websites without taking people out of your app, you can make the experience smooth and seamless by choosing the right API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can display web content inside of your app with both the WKWebView and SFSafariViewController APIs. But which is the best for your app’s needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WKWebView&lt;/strong&gt; is part of the WebKit framework: It allows you to embed web content into your app as a seamless part of your app’s UI. You can present a full or partial view of web content directly in your app by loading a view that leverages existing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content or create your own if your layout and styling requirements are better satisfied by using web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If your app uses the deprecated UIWebView API to display web content, you will need to update your code as soon as possible for improved security, performance, and reliability. Learn more:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12232019b" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Updating Apps that Use Web Views&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SFSafariViewController&lt;/strong&gt; is part of the SafariServices framework, and lets your users browse a web page, or a website right inside your app. With it, people can enjoy the same web browsing experience they get in Safari — including features like Password Autofill, Reader, and Secure Browsing — without ever having to leave your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two APIs can provide a lot of the heavy lifting for web technologies in your app, though there are a few instances where we recommend alternative frameworks. For example, when presenting a web-based login screen for your app, use ASWebAuthenticationSession to provide people with the most secure experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When should I use WKWebView?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need to customize or control the display of web content — or interact with the content itself — WKWebView will be most flexible in helping you build the implementation that suits your needs. (If your app is designed to be used offline, make sure any WKWebView content has appropriate fallbacks and alerts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, consider WKWebView if you need to display HTML or CSS content inline or as part of rest of your app’s user interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4433031D-A849-42F7-8C75-931FFFF84A37/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The Washington Post’s development team implemented WKWebView to display content from the Washington Post website within their app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, WKWebView is an incredibly powerful technology that works in tandem with iOS and macOS frameworks. That said, WKWebView is not designed to outright replace system technologies and frameworks. For example, you should avoid using it in place of device-optimized UIKit classes like UITableView, UIImage, and UIButton, as you lose out on core system behaviors and provide a subpar experience for people who use your app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When should I use SFSafariViewController?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you want display websites inside your app without sending people to Safari, the best tool is SFSafariViewController. By using this API, you can effectively embed the Safari interface — and many of its key features and privacy protections — into your app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/5988B8A3-851E-41E2-9754-AAA6DD38A1B4/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The Apple Developer app displays web links through SFSafariViewController.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;SFSafariViewController is best used when you need to display interactive web experiences on websites you don’t own, or showcase parts of your web content that are generally outside the scope of your app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;WKWebView&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;SFSafariViewController&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Design a great in-app purchase experience for Apple Watch</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=wl3gnk1h</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=wl3gnk1h</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/52AD261D-B8AE-4C7E-A06D-45A9C6F9BEE6/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Apple Watch apps can help people achieve their personal fitness goals, monitor their health, get actionable information straight to their wrist, and so much more. And with watchOS 6.2, you can further expand your customers’ experiences by offering in-app purchases and subscription flows directly on Apple Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These interactions use the same StoreKit APIs available for iOS app development, allowing you to quickly implement them in your watchOS apps, and they can be added to both independent watchOS apps (which can function fully independently of an iOS app) and dependent watchOS apps (which need an iOS companion app to function).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at why and when you might want to offer purchases within your app, as well as some best practices around implementing a great flow for your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to offer in-app purchases and subscriptions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-app purchases and subscriptions can make your Apple Watch apps even better by offering both additional content and purchasing flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an independent app, people can already download it directly through the Watch App Store, and in-app purchases and subscriptions build upon that independence. Apps dependent on the companion iOS app can benefit, too, as these give people more power to purchase additional content without having to reach for their iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deciding whether to bring an in-app purchase or subscription flow to your app, consider what you’re offering. Does this purchase or subscription unlock anything specific to Apple Watch? Fitness apps, for instance, might supply additional workouts, or let your customers subscribe to a monthly program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve decided to add an in-app purchase or subscription, give some thought to when your app should display it. These prompts are most helpful when they provide a next step for your customers to unlock further functionality within your app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Best practices for a great in-app purchase and subscription experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective purchase flows on Apple Watch are concise and clear. Your messaging must be easily scannable, and your options must be easy to compare with each other on a small screen. Keeping things short and sweet will help ensure that people can evaluate the choices, make a decision quickly, and carry on with the task at hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make your choices clear&lt;/strong&gt;
When offering one-time purchases and subscriptions alongside each other, ensure that every option is defined clearly. Adding written overviews can help people differentiate between the two and make an informed choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend including the following information in your overview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What this purchase enables on your Apple Watch app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether it’s a one-time purchase or recurring subscription&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/900CF4E2-E9A0-4E9E-9B86-CBED593648D4/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restore the past&lt;/strong&gt;
Whenever you offer subscription or in-app purchase content, provide a way for people to restore their subscriptions or purchases. The same goes for Apple Watch: Make sure your app presents a button below the option to purchase that can check for previously purchased content and restore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t forget the fine print&lt;/strong&gt;
While reading your subscription’s terms and conditions on Apple Watch may not sound like the most fun way for someone to spend their time, it’s important that your customers know exactly what they’re getting when they purchase something within your app. Every time you include a purchase screen on Apple Watch, you must include an option to read terms and conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/52AD261D-B8AE-4C7E-A06D-45A9C6F9BEE6/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review the App Store guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;
There are specific requirements you need to include in your Watch app before you make in-app purchases and subscriptions available to your customers; check the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/resources/"&gt;App Store’s Guidelines and Resources&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/creating_independent_watchos_apps"&gt;Watch “Creating Independent watchOS apps”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions/#subscription-offers"&gt;Learn more about &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;auto-renewable subscriptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Behind the Design: StaffPad</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=5z97xxqw</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=5z97xxqw</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A73FE0EF-110E-453F-BF9E-2B5C3F614343/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great composers bring forth melody from the silence of their imaginations. Long before the orchestra strikes its first chord, an intermixed whisper of invisible strings, brass and percussion lives within a composer’s mind. Transforming those melodic machinations into sheet music, however, is its own special challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classical greats relied on the tried-and-true method of writing on sheet paper, letting their creativity flow unabashed onto the page. Once written, however, each part had to be painstakingly copied and reproduced for each musician — and revisions were far from easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, modern digital composition software provides an incredible array of tools for composers and musicians. Despite the many benefits of these apps, however, they can come across as cold and complicated, creating unnecessary barriers between the music in someone’s mind and the notes that end up on a music stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was spending more time learning these notation programs... than I was actually writing the music,” composer and designer David William Hearn tells us. This dissonance provided him with the beginnings of a different sort of musical idea: an app that provided the inspirational and inviting structure of pen and paper with the powerful features of a digital notation app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[It] started out as quite a selfish endeavor,” Hearn shares with a smile. “The dream app that I always wanted.” He envisioned something that would not only allow him to write music quickly and with ease, interfacing and interacting with other musicians, but also presented the opportunity to record and playback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/89130EF9-C1B5-4325-A93A-BC0E92D24A5E/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of cofounder and collaborator Dr. Matthew Tesch, Hearn’s dream app became &lt;em&gt;StaffPad&lt;/em&gt;, an innovative approach to musical notation. Since its 2015 launch, StaffPad has continually evolved to take advantage of the latest technology, including a full rebuild and relaunch for iPad and Apple Pencil in early 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Musicians and composers generally appreciate power through simplicity,” says Hearn. “They want to focus on one thing only — the music. Every aspect of StaffPad’s design, both invisible and visible, was built with a no-compromise approach to enable that focus.” Subtle design choices create a feeling of unity between the composer’s environment and the interface as they transition into the app. The main screen’s background even changes color based on the weather and time of day to provide a welcoming atmosphere for creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paradox of choice is fascinating, but personally I feel being offered a couple of great choices beats having loads of potentially poor ones. You do need bravery in the design to believe the few choices you offer are the right ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;David William Hearn, cofounder of StaffPad&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The composition interface is free-form and inviting. The team specifically decided against the idea of a fixed page layout, knowing that people could use StaffPad on a device in any orientation or zoomed at any size. Instead, the app presents composers with an infinitely scrolling digital canvas of sheet music. Rather than ask the creator to pick specific styles or sizes before writing a new composition, they can just start notating, then share the correct size on export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There's certainly a place for having perfect pixel, perfect layout control over every layer,” Hearn says. “But whilst you're in a creative flow, you really don't want to be thinking about page breaks or line breaks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/261BBB10-634B-43C6-82B0-AAEC514ECAAD/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While StaffPad is quite powerful in the options it provides composers, the app intentionally uses adaptive toolsets to help declutter its interface and guide composers to the right tool at the right moment. “We designed the most common things you do to be the most natural,” Hearn says. If a composer is writing for piano, for example, the app won’t display tools designed for percussion instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes notational writing itself. StaffPad requires Apple Pencil — its precision is instrumental to interacting within the app. While the team considered alternative tools, they ultimately went with the methods that mapped accurately to how someone might write on paper. Pencil gives the composer differentiation, whereas touch is a complement to the overall process. “Touch to move. Pencil to draw. We make it very nuanced, but the dual concept is the key,” Hearn says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That exploration also helped identify one of StaffPad’s defining features: toggling the erase tool through drawing pressure. They knew it would break the creative flow to add an extra button to toggle the erase tool. Instead, they relied upon an otherwise unused feature in the app — Apple Pencil’s pressure sensitivity, which isn’t needed for writing notation — and designed an erase toggle when pushing firmly on the Pencil. “I knew it had to be light enough that it didn’t feel dangerous, but also strong enough that it didn’t trigger accidentally while writing,” Hearn says. “We kept trying until it felt right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key feature of the app is its text recognition, which translates handwritten strokes or shapes into digital notes, rests, accidentals, articulations, and dynamics. "It's actually consulting its own sort of music-theory brain,” Hearn says. Even with a scattering of scrawled notes, StaffPad is able to draw upon Core ML frameworks and models to decipher and craft digital orchestrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the app’s ‘selfish’ origins, StaffPad has found support from people across the musical world. “One of my favorite things about the app is that it's fostered this sense of kind of community ownership,” Hearn says. “People are really quite emotionally attached to it in a lot of ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearn and team receive regular suggestions, feedback, and stories from their community. His favorite emails are those from teachers and students: “That raw inspiration that comes from the education sector is really amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/13E73672-6715-4ECA-81B0-8462A5D18CDE/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;StaffPad continues to explore new ways to support its audience, including its companion app, StaffPad Reader. The app allows musicians to digitally view and play scores from StaffPad, and even automatically turns pages in unison as they rehearse or perform. If the composer edits or transposes a score on StaffPad, the app also receives changes over the air, reformatting the parts in realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearn and Tesch have even begun the process of introducing another natural input interface into the app: voice. “I believe voice will become a primary input method for most apps in the near future,” says Hearn. “Voice provides a vector into a nearly unlimited command set — and one that we already know how to use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning an Apple Design Award is just one note on the team’s musical journey. “There’s always more to do,” Hearn says. But over the last few years, he’s found joy in helping craft both the app and working with the team behind it. “A composer is a solitary animal,” he notes. An app-building team, less so. “[My] main learning has been how best to work to create a cohesive design and then explain that to a team of people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.staffpad.net/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Learn more about StaffPad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1521731004" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Learn more about StaffPad on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/staffpad/id1442074103" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Download StaffPad on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Behind the Design: Sky: Children of the Light</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=zm47it7t</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=zm47it7t</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/1D9F24DC-2226-40B2-AD63-17A62D51BA2E/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest pieces of art resonate within your mind and capture your heart. They pull you into lush, beautiful narratives, and keep you dreaming about their stories long after you walk away. And they can take many forms. “Many people cry for a movie or novel,” Jenova Chen tells us. “The first entertainment that made me cry was a game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former film student, Chen never planned on a career in game development — he wanted to tell captivating stories and touch people’s lives. But while in school, he soon found himself gravitating toward interactive media. Together with co-founder Kellee Santiago, Chen created thatgamecompany to enhance human connection by expanding the range of emotional experiences possible in video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C270D324-D052-4272-BD71-6BAE022B2848/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The world of Sky: Children of the Light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first 30 to 40 years, games were more designed for the core audience, the enthusiasts who embrace the new things,” Chen says. "But we are really now entering a new era… Everybody plays games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studio’s first six years in operation resulted in Flow, Flower, and Journey, three award-winning games for Sony’s Playstation console. Their fourth game, &lt;em&gt;Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/em&gt;, is the first created exclusively for iPhone and iPad. Though the artwork, controls, and story are new, the game’s spirit remains aligned with its predecessors: Make interactive art, designed for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to be the ultimate advocate for the human who plays our games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jenova Chen, creative director of Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At its core, &lt;em&gt;Sky&lt;/em&gt; is a game about compassion and generosity,” Chen, the game’s creative director, says. “It’s about connecting people and nudging them to do good for each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Sky&lt;/em&gt;, players begin as a child of light, seeking fallen stars — the ancestral spirits of the realms. Players fly across cloudy dreamlike spaces, solving puzzles cooperatively and socializing within an enchanting world. While solo play is possible, &lt;em&gt;Sky&lt;/em&gt; shines when fellow players work together. “It tries to evoke the bright side of humanity over the dark or the gray in an online game,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C1891445-B4AE-4EC0-8C3E-EA0DCF695789/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The multiplayer game celebrates collaboration and connection over competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on, it was clear that &lt;em&gt;Sky&lt;/em&gt; would be an ambitious title for Chen and the creative team. This would be their first game for a mobile device, the first that relied on touch instead of console controllers, and their first attempt at an online multiplayer experience — one that celebrated connection over conflict. The team ultimately worked for seven years before bringing &lt;em&gt;Sky&lt;/em&gt; to life, with more than 70 people contributing to the game over its creative development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/AD03EB11-0201-4551-B158-63A8136877AD/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen was drawn to mobile gaming for &lt;em&gt;Sky&lt;/em&gt; in part because of the approachability of iPhone and iPad. “When we design games, we should really think about accessibility and inclusion, to allow the game to be enjoyed by everyone,” he says. Consoles are expensive, and families generally only have a single piece of hardware and a few controllers within their household. In contrast, almost everyone owns a mobile device — it was the perfect platform for a multiplayer game that was open to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition from console to iPhone and iPad was a challenge for the entire studio. When the team began working on &lt;em&gt;Sky&lt;/em&gt; in 2012, they were limited by the mobile hardware and screen sizes of that era — a far cry from the powerful Playstation infrastructure supporting their previous titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, the iPhone is actually more powerful than the PlayStation that we developed for in the past,” Chen says, and &lt;em&gt;Sky&lt;/em&gt; runs beautifully on both it and iPad. But to get there, the team had to iterate over multiple years of hardware and software updates. They were constantly refining the game’s look and feel, including developing a custom Metal engine to render &lt;em&gt;Sky&lt;/em&gt;’s ethereal scenes, all while making sure the game would perform well and preserve battery life on device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/605C3AD5-669E-441B-8770-61B2BF06E898/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While engineers worked on the technical challenges, the game’s designers got to work creating the right control mechanisms and interface. “There are many, many barriers and design principles [on mobile] that are quite alien to console developers,” Chen says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief of these was the touch screen: Players needed to traverse a three-dimensional space without physical buttons, triggers, or joysticks, and without on-screen controls blocking the game’s graphics or interface. “You're trying to find the right combination of design and feedback that is actually better than a real controller,” Chen explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A player’s past gaming history was also an important factor in designing the controls. While console gaming often requires players to interact with a physical controller using both hands, that wasn’t the case for casual gamers. “Players without a console controller experience would never put two hands on the screen at the same time,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A3D23329-F522-42D4-B51E-91172D919993/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After several years of experimentation — including, at one point, a fully-functional flight simulator — the team landed on a simple set of familiar controls designed to appeal to everyone. For extra guidance, Chen and team even provided subtle interface rings in each corner, which expand and contract to indicate range and speed control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That wasn’t the last of the controller changes, however. After Sky’s initial release and feedback from players, the team also added a two-hand mode to the game for those who wanted more of a console-like feel. “This is the first time I’ve made a game where the control scheme was not finite,” Chen says. But he also acknowledges the beauty in creating a game on a living platform. “We are actually making changes because the habit of how people use their phone is changing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s this relationship between player and creator that Chen finds fascinating about games. As with any artistic medium, the creator has the power to help amplify feelings and guide people through a story — its rises and falls, surges and sudden stops. “For design and for entertainment, it is all about that change of acceleration,” Chen says. “That pulse is what touches us emotionally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/365FDB19-7AC4-4AE6-882F-412C0D31A346/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B08C0BF1-CBAA-4707-82BD-FCD42CAD82C4/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/01BBBC8C-A14A-4624-B874-99F74C49109F/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interactivity of a game, however, creates a unique challenge for designers not to weigh too heavily upon the frame — to guide, but not to restrict. “The best design is a nudge, rather than a leash,” he says. “We want to make whomever is experiencing the [game] feel they are in control... We are not here to distract you. We are not here to force and bully you to do anything. We want to let you to make that [step]... and 100 percent own that experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The designer is a powerful influence of what happens between the player who touches your interface and interacts with your game. With very small changes in the design, you can change how this person behaves, how they treat each other in your game. It's your responsibility... how are these players going to interact with your app, with your game, on a daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jenova Chen, creative director of Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s this balance and fervent commitment to storytelling and inclusivity that makes &lt;em&gt;Sky&lt;/em&gt; a joy for all to play — and a 2020 Apple Design Award winner. “Hearing from people that they appreciate the work that we've done is the best reward, really,” says Chen. “Ultimately, we are serving others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thatgamecompany.com" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Learn more about thatgamecompany&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thatgamecompany.com/sky/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Learn more about Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sky-children-of-the-light/id1462117269" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Download Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1521580255" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Read more about Sky: Children of the Light on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Updates to Coding Terminology</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1o9zxsxl</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1o9zxsxl</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Apple, we’re working to remove and replace non-inclusive language across our developer ecosystem, including within Xcode, platform APIs, documentation, and open source projects. These changes began on June 22 with the beta software and developer documentation released at WWDC20 moving to terms such as &lt;em&gt;allow list&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;deny list&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; as the default SCM branch in Xcode 12. An updated &lt;a href="https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/#/"&gt;Apple Style Guide&lt;/a&gt; reflects these and other changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer APIs with exclusionary terms will be deprecated as we introduce replacements across internal codebases, public APIs, and open source projects, such as WebKit and Swift. We encourage you to closely monitor deprecation warnings across your codebases and to proactively move to the latest APIs available in the platform SDKs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Behind the Design: Where Cards Fall</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=fy6rx06s</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=fy6rx06s</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/00C4DCC1-0087-4611-8699-A2E5C744FDEE/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staking your future on a house of cards may not seem like the best idea for a career. And yet, Sam Rosenthal dealt himself a winning hand with his studio’s game, &lt;em&gt;Where Cards Fall&lt;/em&gt; — one more than nine years in the making. “&lt;em&gt;Where Cards Fall&lt;/em&gt; was a labor of love for the better part of my life,” he says. Originating as a student project while Rosenthal attended USC, the game evolved over years of late-night coffee shop sessions into a 2020 Apple Design Award winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wouldn’t let [&lt;em&gt;Where Cards Fall&lt;/em&gt;] go,” he says. “We had confidence that we were making something special and different and interesting.” Despite early rejections from publishers, Rosenthal and his collaborators cut through a deck stacked against them to make the kind of game they wanted to see more of in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B99BAD58-265F-45C8-B311-BAA7BA640BD1/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, Rosenthal had an early passion for games and game design. But he found little he could share with his friends or family, who weren’t as interested in the medium. “There weren’t many experiences that they could really relate to,” he says. So Rosenthal set out to create some. In college, he dreamed up the idea for &lt;em&gt;Where Cards Fall&lt;/em&gt; — a story about growing up and “the messiness of life” — while listening to Radiohead’s “House of Cards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game mechanics are intentionally simple, using common system gestures on each platform to explore the story and its card-based puzzles. It’s both a core part of &lt;em&gt;Where Cards Fall&lt;/em&gt; and the founding principle of Rosenthal’s studio The Game Band: Make beautiful games that resonate with the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/488DF477-DCE8-4FA2-99A8-93E195FCC21A/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're creating these little boxes of exploration for people,” Rosenthal says. “Little places for them to discover something that might delight them, or might teach them something about themselves.” In &lt;em&gt;Where Cards Fall&lt;/em&gt;, people explore the memories of the protagonist, an aspiring architect. Those memories are wordlessly described through sound, music, and exquisitely crafted 3D spaces, along with the game’s eponymous cards — which provide glimpses into the past as you build them into structures, doorways, reconstructed spaces, and bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game's architectural motif, in many ways, illustrates Rosenthal’s entire philosophy around game design, which he describes an invisible art. “When you go into a beautifully designed building, the way that you navigate through the space is not an accident,” he says. Game design, too, provides the player with that structure — giving them the framework to experience feelings, ideas, and interactions within a living story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often the invisible arts are the ones that affect us the most, or they just change our perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Sam Rosenthal, creative director of Where Cards Fall&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When crafting the mechanics and design of &lt;em&gt;Where Cards Fall&lt;/em&gt;, Rosenthal and his team took inspiration from both gaming and the larger art world. Games like &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Witness&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; series helped the studio as they explored onboarding, pacing, and the game’s puzzle structure, while &lt;em&gt;Inside&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt; brought the team new ideas on crafting an “unforgettable atmosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/1B0A1A8A-9133-475D-A4F6-95573FB40213/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art director Joshua Harvey designed the game’s moody, moving artwork, which is partially influenced by the Bauhaus movement — a celebration of the mathematical underpinning in shapes and lines. The art is designed to work in tandem with the game’s interface, blending everything together to create the perfect atmosphere while still providing helpful guidance for the player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We often think of UI as this separate layer on top of the game’s art style, but a successful art style is simultaneously beautiful and functional,” Rosenthal says. In &lt;em&gt;Where Cards Fall&lt;/em&gt;, the grass nibs in the forest and the tiles in the city are specifically arranged to help the player see the grid for planning their structures, while the brickwork on the sides of certain platforms provides subtle cues to help players discern heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/DF5B30A4-5CEA-4B49-AC27-99C7C9E8B48E/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/EA7C02A6-E35C-46E3-972C-770D3B4DA0EB/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The game’s icon further stylizes the protagonist of Where Cards Fall during the story’s present-day winter forest. “It’s not somebody that is lost in the past, but somebody that maybe has learned from what happened, has reflected, and is looking towards what could be,” says Rosenthal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game’s hand-drawn aesthetic also ties back into the main character's interest in art and architecture. “Drawing is [their] way of processing the world and imagining what it could be,” Rosenthal says. “It gives the player a stronger connection to the protagonist and the passion that drives them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the many influences the team drew upon to craft *Where Cards Fall, the game has its own unique style and tone, in part due to the work they put in to stay aligned across game mechanics, sound, music, and art design. “We found it crucial to create a set of internal rules so that we could stay cohesive,” Rosenthal says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cards and their puzzles were a big part of creating these guidelines. “I originally thought big, sprawling puzzles would be intriguing, but quickly realized that smaller ones created the most interesting challenges,” he explains. “Once I had an overarching style, I began to develop smaller rules: A pile of cards should be used in at least two different places, otherwise it feels extraneous. And players should never have to restart a puzzle, since that discourages experimentation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/159ECC9C-DEF4-45C6-AB8A-02C3BEDA6C16/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F745B88C-6B1C-4930-BE4E-6D99180E9700/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/DA385E51-2750-41A5-A92D-B629648396E6/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The card interactions themselves went through multiple revisions during the game’s development. The team used a physical deck to experiment with the physics and interaction of card-based structures, exploring both single-card draws and a multi-card spread — the latter of which became the game’s core mechanic. (It even had precedent within iOS: At the time, the Photos app allowed people to skeuomorphically splay their images from a stack with a pinch and spread gesture.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Players tend to interact with the platforms in the ways that they’re used to, especially if they don’t play many games,” Rosenthal says. They followed that same philosophy when moving &lt;em&gt;Where Cards Fall&lt;/em&gt; over to Mac and Apple TV, identifying platform-specific gestures that would be easy for a player to adopt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One downside of platform-specific adaptation: the player needs to relearn how to interact with the game. Fortunately, Rosenthal and his team had thought through an excellent tutorial and gameplay system. They created a hand-drawn overlay to animate paths, controls, and future actions, and used the main character to physically communicate possible destructive interactions — a shake of the head when attempting to tear down a card structure, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/CFDAD680-1BED-488C-B375-1099CC6CAEB0/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music and the soundscape provide their own cues as the player works their way through the game. The cards have distinctive, fluttery sounds as they’re built and collapsed — audio director Kristi Knupp purchased stacks of card stock to find the perfect tone — while the background blends the naturalistic and physical noises of the forest and cityscape environments with Torin Borrowdale’s score. “It’s very easy to manipulate people’s emotions with music,” Rosenthal says. “But we wanted the experience to be the main thing that was setting the emotional weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;em&gt;Where Cards Fall&lt;/em&gt; tells its story through the player’s journey. It eschews audible dialogue or on-screen text for similar reasons. “There's a lot of empty space for reflection,” Rosenthal says — a core theme of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F08E0F6E-CD5A-4A06-BD64-673E0DAD7C00/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Rosenthal, The Game Band, and their publishing partner Snowman have the opportunity to reflect on winning an Apple Design Award. “It [was] beyond my wildest expectations,” he says. “There are so many different hands that touched it, and every one of them put their personal stamp on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His advice to fellow creators? Find your collaborators and keep going — even when it feels impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're all working so hard just to make beautiful things exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's a really, really hard thing to do; to really believe in something, especially when it's something that's not obvious. Right? A lot of times when you're working on something, you know it needs to be out there. You know what its value is. But you've got to convince a lot of other people that it's going to be valuable, especially when it's in its early stages and is not beautiful yet, but it will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Sam Rosenthal, creative director of Where Cards Fall&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wherecardsfall.com/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Where Cards Fall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thegameband.com" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;The Game Band&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://builtbysnowman.com" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Snowman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/where-cards-fall/id1466331487" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Download Where Cards Fall on Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1521579599" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Read more about Where Cards Fall on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>How to review your app’s crash logs</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=nra79npr</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=nra79npr</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/9EE6FB44-CE4D-4197-B833-D85598A153CA/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we’d all prefer it if our apps never crashed, the logs captured from those crashes can help you troubleshoot bugs and get your app up and running again. If and when something goes awry, your app automatically gathers crash reports from people who have opted in to send you anonymized crash data. And you can view that data using the Xcode Organizer on your Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: While there are several third-party analytics tools that can also provide information on crashing threads when incorporated into your app, you may not always be able to see the full backtrace. Additionally, the log you receive may not be in a format you can send to Apple when filing feedback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you can access full crash reports directly from Xcode and your Mac’s Finder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Find your app’s crash logs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to view your app’s crash logs. The first provides you with at-a-glance information — like the percentage of people running into crashes on an earlier version of iOS — while the other offers a more detailed look at individual crash reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;strong&gt;Xcode&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;Window&lt;/strong&gt; from the menu bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;Organizer &amp;gt; Crashes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;strong&gt;App Store&lt;/strong&gt; from the drop down menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/10C861E6-34C3-45F8-A41B-55E477A530D0/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The Xcode Organizer displays crashes reported by your app, organized by the issue and frequency. You’ll only be able to see information from people who have opted to share anonymized crash reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, you can see crash reports from your app’s builds, including TestFlight betas and versions you’ve released to the App Store. Browse all of your crashes at a glance, and check out statistics to see how crashes break down across OS versions and different devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you want to start troubleshooting on the spot, you can even open a crash report and jump right to the affected line in Xcode by simply choosing the &lt;strong&gt;Open In Project&lt;/strong&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Review your app’s crash logs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To check out individual crash logs in detail, you’ll need to engage the power of your Control key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control-click&lt;/strong&gt; on the crash in question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;strong&gt;Show in Finder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Finder window, &lt;strong&gt;control-click&lt;/strong&gt; the highlighted .xccrashpoint file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;strong&gt;Show Package Contents&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the folder that displays, go to &lt;strong&gt;DistributionInfos &amp;gt; all &amp;gt; Logs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the Logs folder, you’ll find each individual crash report, which you can browse and troubleshoot accordingly. You can also use these crash reports when reporting feedback to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/diagnosing_issues_using_crash_reports_and_device_logs"&gt;Learn more about diagnosing issues using crash reports and &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;device logs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to start designing assets in Display P3</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=5cda5ipr</link>

<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/FCDAF5D6-98D1-48A8-A6D9-883655C51973/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eye-catching icon or splash of color can focus attention and help people locate the right information inside your app. Consider designing those assets in the Display P3 color space: They’ll look richer and more vibrant on any device with a wide color gamut display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find wide color gamut Retina displays on most Macs, as well as iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. They bring more true-to-life colors and deep hues to the screen, not only making for excellent image and video viewing but also heightening people’s everyday app experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Display P3 assets in your app to amplify important elements of your interface: the colors of a VU meter in an audio app, for instance, or the redline in a rev counter inside your racing game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you display photography or video in your app, you should consider using Display P3 to help images stay true to the camera’s original capture. Shopping apps can help people choose the right item by showcasing the true color of a certain dress or pair of pants. You can also use Display P3 for your app icon to highlight colors and smooth out gradients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in exploring Display P3 for your assets? To get started, you’ll need to get your tools ready to work in that color space. We’ll show you how to design in Display P3 using two popular Mac apps: Adobe Photoshop and Sketch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Does your display support Display P3?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your hardware tools are just as important as your software tools: Ensure that the device you use to create assets supports the Display P3 color space so that you can preview your designs accurately. That includes all iMacs with Retina displays, 2016 and later MacBook Pro, LG’s UltraFine 4K or 5K Display, and the Pro Display XDR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Set up a new Display P3 canvas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to configure your canvas to support Display P3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a new Display P3 canvas in Photoshop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Adobe Photoshop on your Mac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the &lt;strong&gt;Create new&lt;/strong&gt; button from the main interface. (You can also create new documents at any time by going to the toolbar and selecting &lt;strong&gt;File &amp;gt; New&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the dimensions and any other information you wish to customize for your canvas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under Color Mode, change your color depth from 8 to &lt;strong&gt;16 bit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Below Color Profile, select &lt;strong&gt;Display P3&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt; to begin designing in Display P3. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/782CC77F-A3B9-455F-9142-51AE9404D631/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;You can avoid manually creating a canvas for every new asset by saving your settings as a preset. Name your preset at the top of the screen, press the Save button, then press Save Preset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a new Display P3 canvas in Sketch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Sketch on your Mac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;File &amp;gt; Change Color Profile&lt;/strong&gt; (or use the keyboard command Shift-Command-K).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;Display P3&lt;/strong&gt; as your Color Profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;strong&gt;Assign&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C1434B6C-0AAC-435F-8797-E076FF7A0654/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Use Sketch’s Color Profile settings to use Display P3 on your canvas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convert an existing sRGB image into P3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you receive image assets from someone else, ensure those assets are converted to Display P3 directly from the RAW file, and not from sRGB, as some color information will be lost in the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you must import an existing image in Photoshop, use &lt;strong&gt;Convert to Profile&lt;/strong&gt; to preserve your design as much as possible. If you use Assign To Profile, that will take your existing colors and stretch them into the new color space, changing your design along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sketch, after you’ve received your file, go to &lt;strong&gt;File &amp;gt; Change Color Profile&lt;/strong&gt; to edit your Color Profile. Then select &lt;strong&gt;Convert&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Export your work in Display P3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’re done creating your asset, you can preserve the Display P3 color space in any file you export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to export your work in Photoshop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: While there are multiple ways of creating assets from the work you do in Photoshop, like Generator or Export As, only using Save As will maintain your Display P3 color space and 16-bit color depth settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the toolbar and select &lt;strong&gt;File &amp;gt; Save As…&lt;/strong&gt; (or type Shift-Command-S).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose where you’d like to save your asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If needed, name your asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under Format, select PNG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Below Color, make sure the &lt;strong&gt;Embed Color Profile: Display P3&lt;/strong&gt; setting is checked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/D4A92AE6-1A3E-4347-9370-55F5330ECCDE/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Export your P3 assets in Photoshop using the Embed Color Profile option in the Save As screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to export your work in Sketch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sketch preserves your color profile upon export, allowing you to save your P3 work in the same manner as other assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Sketch, go to the &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt; menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the export option you need: &lt;strong&gt;Export&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Export Current Selection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/2570602C-9E0F-4304-82F2-1E48A40B8D9E/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apple Design Awards celebrate innovation, ingenuity, design excellence, and outstanding technical achievement. A WWDC tradition, the ADAs highlight those who take thoughtful and creative approaches to their apps and games, giving people new ways to work, play, or imagine things that were never before possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been awarding great design for more than two decades now, and each year’s winners set new standards for others to emulate,” said John Geleynse, Senior Director of Evangelism and longtime host of the Apple Design Awards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s winners are no different: Their apps are beautiful, intuitive, captivating and delightful. They spring from a deep understanding of and empathy for the people they’re intended to serve. They are unique, exhaustively refined, and crafted with care and attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;

															&lt;p class="activity-description"&gt;Join us as we surprise the 2020 winners of the Apple Design Awards. The Apple Design Awards recognize excellence in design and innovation for apps and games across all of Apple’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
														&lt;/section&gt;
													&lt;/section&gt;
												&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Winning apps require a lot of work,” said Geleynse, “And we want to honor the effort, dedication, creativity, and new ideas that lead to innovative solutions like these.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the honor continues beyond an Apple Design Award and FaceTime celebration: Starting this Friday and each week thereafter, the Developer app will feature exclusive interviews with each winner about their creative process and how they brought their bold and distinctive ideas to life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a quick look at this year’s Apple Design Award winners, along with a few choice highlights from our upcoming interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/3C9D1511-7FD1-4115-BB22-E884F9D7D52B/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Majd Taby, Darkroom&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've tried to abstract away all the complexity of photo editing — no import, no export, hiding away the complexity unless you ask for it... the app is much more powerful and complex than the design… that's just part of the ongoing design challenge of trying to make something that's usable and powerful at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/0923DBD6-4FD8-42FC-9F22-4EE6B58656FB/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eran Hilleli, Looom&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The design thought of Looom is the flow first — experience first... Trying to make drawn animation exist in some tool that was almost like a Gameboy... something you can kick back and relax, which is not something that, usually, animation is about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/6B303CFE-A9A5-418F-B5C9-C85922E28BA7/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;István Csanády, Shapr3D&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that great interaction design is... always a lot of blood, sweat, and tears... There are no shortcuts because this is something that you can't really figure out. You just have to observe how your users actually want to interact your with design or with your software... we did hundreds of prototypes, interaction prototypes -- you can step-by-step get to the right solution... it took us four and a half years to get to this level of polish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/D6EEE6D7-9094-4B62-BE73-ADE98122A761/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;David William Hearn, StaffPad&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The core tenet of the app is really: How is this helping me write music? How is this making my day nicer and better and hopefully making me write better music? If it can help me do that, and at least if I finish a project and I don’t feel exhausted at the end of it, then I think that every idea has been worth it. But there’s always more to do. It’s never done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/DDF0B61B-60A6-4B85-BDE2-224FBFCC35AC/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Simon Flesser, Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a game that is very much about the music, right?... It started very differently, with a much more sinister tone. But then as we were playing our prototype, randomly, this really energetic, pop song came on in the background... And it sort of just clicked. I literally said, ‘This is it.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/716DB87C-9F4A-4F3F-90E6-7BFE90EF99D3/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Jenova Chen, Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With very small changes in the design, you can change how [the player] behaves, how they treat each other in your game. I think it’s your responsibility to think about: How are these players going to interact with your app, with your game, you know, on a daily basis? Is that healthy for them? Is that going to make them be thankful... rather than having resentment of the experience?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/71CCE30A-277B-4285-BB0B-D8379F298C08/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Philipp Stollenmayer, Song of Bloom&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes it’s hard to tell what the game is trying to tell you. Some images are so abstract that you have to make up your own interpretation. To help the game communicate on every available channel, it was important to give it another sense... from the haptic vibrations, it helps you to understand if this is an active scene or a calm one — you get a really nice sense for the mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A045F85A-FCC7-4A4D-A4AC-32D238680A96/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sam Rosenthal, Where Cards Fall&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of the game feels very melancholic but at the same time — it's a hopeful game. So the app icon is our main character in the winter — which is the present day — looking up... It is not somebody that is lost in the past but somebody that maybe has learned from what happened, has reflected and is looking towards what could be next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more about the Apple Design Award winners on Apple Newsroom and the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-honors-eight-developers-with-annual-apple-design-awards/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Read more about the Apple Design Award winners on Apple Newsroom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1517413678" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Read more about the Apple Design Award winners on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Changing the world, one Swift playground at a time</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=aprhkd7d</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=aprhkd7d</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/8B3B0EB0-739F-44E9-BF02-99CE803CA6B8/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, students from all around the world put their passion, ingenuity, and determination to work crafting Swift playground projects for the WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge. Students from 60 different countries and regions brought their talents to the table, using the challenge’s three-minute limit to stretch their imaginations and explore Apple’s frameworks and technologies. The resulting 350 Swift Student Challenge winners have created AR experiences, projects powered by machine learning, educational material, virtual musical instruments, 8-bit games, and so much more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Swipe to unlock&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, after having studied just one month at the Apple Developer Academy in Porto Alegre, Brazil, Henrique Conte submitted his first Swift playground project. While he didn’t win a WWDC Scholarship that year, the experience drove him to continue exploring and refining his code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This year I felt that, after reading and studying about so many different Apple frameworks, I should try to accomplish the WWDC19 main phrase: ‘Write code. Blow minds,’” he told us. And he did. His winning submission, a three-minute game designed for MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar, excels in both its technical acuity and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the playground, players have to help Eleanor, a young developer, escape from a cave. The twist: The “cave” level is entirely located within the Touch Bar. “I chose to use unusual frameworks to show that it is possible to do amazing things with them,” Conte said. “I feel that [the Touch Bar] has so much potential yet to be discovered, and I wanted to demonstrate some of its capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/9224C2B2-8900-441B-97B7-2BCF27DD98F8/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Henrique Conte’s winning submission, “ESCape, Eleanor!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he had never previously developed for macOS, Conte immediately took to the challenge. Like learning any new development concept, he ran into a few initial obstacles — “when I received the message “No such module 'UIKit’ [after trying to add it to my project] I noticed things would get interesting,” he joked — but he quickly picked up the fundamentals of Mac programming, using AppKit and SpriteKit to build a fully-interactive experience, including taps, slides, keyboard integrations, and multi-screen storytelling. He also paid close attention to the design, something that has become increasingly important to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am definitely not a designer,” says Conte, “But in the past few years I noticed how essential it is to follow Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and to provide a great experience. There is no point in creating a perfect code if people will have trouble using your application!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find more of Conte’s work on the App Store: In the last year, he’s created four apps, including one to help children with autism communicate. He’s currently at work on his next project, which he’s building for both iOS and macOS, that addresses the problem of food waste. And — he’s happy to report — the macOS version will incorporate the Touch Bar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The world turned upside-down&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louise Pieri, 21, fell in love with computer science at a young age in her native Lyons, France. She’s since gone on to study at École 42, the programming school founded by French businessman Xavier Niel. Pieri’s winning project, Meep, drew inspiration from an article she read in a scientific journal about the possibility of parallel universes, as well as her own personal journey as a transgender woman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Meep is a game with two levels: the first is a level where everything is reversed and upside-down and the second is where everything is normal,” says Pieri. “The story is about a little blue transgender monster who wants to reach the final level and turn pink... it's a beautiful metaphor for what happens in the life of a trans person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/5BF1B7E8-9B77-427C-84C8-CCA2E23492DC/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Louise Pieri’s winning submission, “Meep”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Pieri had never previously used SpriteKit or AVKit, she knew she wanted to build a game for her Swift playground submission. She spent two days brainstorming ideas before landing on the concept for Meep and diving into the frameworks and interface. Initially, she’d hoped to show both of Meep’s universes on-screen at once before deciding on a multi-level experience, including an entire level upside-down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to designing and coding the game, Pieri also created her own 2D artwork for each level in Adobe Illustrator and a story for the game — all in under two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pieri has been tuning into WWDC20 this year from France, and is especially keen to learn more about the future of Apple platforms. “I can't wait to get to know iOS 14,” she says. That will come in handy for her next project — bringing a version of Meep to the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A robot of one’s own&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devin Green’s love of development stemmed from a lifelong fascination with thinking machines. “I have always been in awe of artificial intelligence,” he told us. Out of that idea, the 18-year-old’s winning project — an AI bot named Stanny — was born. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With everything that is going on in the world right now, I thought people stuck in isolation might find it beneficial to their mental health to talk to a capable AI companion,” he said. Green, who will attend Stanford this fall for computer science and engineering, took about a week to build his playground — most of that time dedicated to refining machine learning models that created Stanny’s ‘intelligence.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The model was trained on a data file made up of all the things you could possibly say to Stanny,” Green said. After researching how others had trained chat bots, Green created his own model in TensorFlow, then brought it to his Xcode playground through Core ML Converters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/70482B7A-F878-4FF2-8BFD-DF6A08377281/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Devin Green’s winning submission, “Polar Patterns”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no stranger to experimenting with machine learning models, Green used this project to get to know more of Apple’s ML offerings. “I wanted to make it as simple as possible to go from data to usable Artificial Intelligence,” he told us. He worked with NSLinguisticsTagger to build a working model, then created a generated Core ML model to predict the person’s intent from their query and architected his playground in SwiftUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green sees Swift as the future of machine learning and AI applications. “Swift is not only a really simple and easy to use language, it’s also really expansive,” he told us. “It can be built on in such a way that [it] is capable of doing just about anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanny isn’t quite as full-featured: His joke-loving AI is limited to only 63 different intents. But Green has big plans — and he can’t wait to incorporate some of the technology announced at WWDC20. “The Natural Language framework is astounding,” he told us. “If I had any doubts about using Swift for machine learning, they quickly disappeared while watching a natural language processing application understand text with about five lines of code... projects I’ve created, like Stanny, are about to get 100x better!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Code as design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For first-time winner Renata Pôrto, the challenge gave her a chance to confront her own self-doubts. “As a designer, I have always felt insecurity regarding my ability to code more complex ideas,” she said. After two unsuccessful Swift playground submissions in previous years, the 21-year old student from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in Recife, Brazil had once again decided to submit. But after a few days of work, she scrapped the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was not satisfied with my own decision to continue with a ‘safe’ idea,” she told us. Instead, she began considering concepts she’d wanted to learn about but hadn’t yet explored — including generative art. “One of the things I always thought was fantastic about programming is the possibility of transforming lines of code into visual and interactive experiences,” she said. Just six days later, she emerged with Polar Patterns, a Swift playground that helps people learn more about mathematical roses and generate their own visual art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With SpriteKit, I was able to convert the polar equation of mathematical roses into SKShapes, transforming the results from the formula into visual elements,” she said. Pôrto designed just two images herself, relying on her algorithmic code and a few UIKit elements to create the entire visual experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing an entirely programmatic art interface was a departure for Pôrto. “I am very used to prototyping before programming,” she told us. This project, however, involved creating an experience that would dynamically shift and change depending on what actions someone took within the playground, making it important for Pôrto to visualize and experiment constantly to perfect her interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/3D8EBEA1-483B-4844-A2E0-A92FDF019632/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Renata Pôrto’s winning submission, “Polar Patterns”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result brings the beauty and complexity of polar roses to a Swift playground — and landed Pôrto a winning submission. “It’s a great joy learning about development, even though I am a design student,” she told us. “Studying design helped me to practice my empathy for [people] and to know what resources to use and how to work with them to achieve better results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That empathy continues through her work with a local developer group, creating educational tools for new developers in her community. “I always try to pass on my design knowledge to developers, and my developer knowledge to designers,” she said. “And hopefully one day they will make products that make a difference in other people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more about the Swift Student Challenge winners.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=zvqmpiak" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Swift Student Challenge winners determined to shape the future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1517413279" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;App Store: Meet the Swift Student Challenge winners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>The music of WWDC</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09pr41a8</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09pr41a8</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C2128BCE-14A0-4D0B-A2B3-F0DE037D47E9/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t be WWDC without a little music. Bring Khalid and The Killers into your living room and create your very own musical conference experience with the WWDC20 playlist collection, now available on Apple Music. The opening WWDC20 playlist features great artists like Glass Animals and Alicia Keys, and includes Aurora from this year’s opening video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Apple Music is celebrating the powerful connection the development community has to music with a new “Music to Code to” series, which features several multi-hour playlists featuring different musical styles and genres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F1F6A358-BA7E-4B55-AD1E-DF7035DCBB18/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers have long found connection and inspiration from music. Sam Rosenthal, creator of The Game Band’s &lt;em&gt;Where Cards Fall&lt;/em&gt; on Apple Arcade, told us that his company name pays homage to the groups he listened to growing up. “A lot of the bands that I really loved… They didn't stick with one sound,” he said. Rosenthal has carried that philosophy into his work: “Every time we make something, it should be different from the last. It should surprise people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, like writer and Shortcuts developer Federico Viticci, have built entire projects around a love of music. In 2019, the Italian native designed and built a shortcut, MusicBot, that helps people listen to more of their library and speed up common Music app interactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When developing MusicBot, I needed to test it with data that was easy to find in my music library,” he told us. Viticci's choice: His “all-time favorite band,” Oasis, whose myriad albums provided plenty of testing material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of the Swift Student Challenge winners also shared their appreciation for a little musical motivation. “While I was creating [my] Playground, I used the WWDC19 playlist,” Gloria Cretella told us. A two-time scholarship winner, Cretella attended the conference for the first time in 2019, and used the playlist to remind herself of the experience. “I was a bit nostalgic,” she said. “Programming with the songs that were in the background at the conference brought me back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their favorite tune or perfect mix. Brazillian Student Challenge winner Henrique Conte finds joy in French music while he codes, especially from his favorite Belgian singer Angèle. “Learning new languages is one of my passions because it allows us to connect with the world and understand cultures,” he told us. With this playlist, he said, he gets to improve his linguistic skills all while Angèle’s music focuses him on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, like StaffPad developer and composer David William Hearn, prefer to find time in the quieter moments between projects. “I’m actually reconnecting at the moment with some of the classics,” he told us, which include works by 20th century composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Though some of those compositions are short by classical standards, Hearn is quick to highlight the years of artistry and care behind them. “It's someone’s life, you know?” he said. “I find that phenomenal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discover the perfect soundtrack for your next programming project on Apple Music or wherever you like to listen, and know that you’re enjoying something uniquely human. “Music transcends our differences and has the power to unite us,” Viticci said. “To make us feel connected no matter what's going on in the world.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can tune in to the full WWDC20 playlist collection on Apple Music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewMultiRoom?fcId=1516383883&amp;ls=1" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;WWDC20 on Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here’s an excerpt from HomeCourt co-founder Philip Lam’s journey to support athletes and basketball players stuck at home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few weeks after the pandemic started, NEX Team cofounder Philip Lam noticed something unusual about HomeCourt, his company’s basketball-training app: Users were hacking it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unable to get to gyms and courts, athletes figured out how to adapt the app’s groundbreaking artificial intelligence—designed to track basketball shots, dribbles, and passes with an iPhone or iPad camera—for soccer, in-line skating, hockey, and other sports. “There’s no way for us to determine if you’re using a basketball,” says Lam. “People started noticing that it just worked.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1517414469" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Read more on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conversations at WWDC&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tune in for two special events later this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/693B7F15-13C4-4D70-B89A-C4CA611F89DF/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Lisa hosts a discussion with former US Attorney General Eric Holder on the fight for equal justice, how technology can empower people to change the world for the better, and ways to help in this moment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Optimize for Apple Silicon with performance and efficiency cores</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vk3m204o</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vk3m204o</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/E757415B-9524-40D7-BADB-4F33ED4508F2/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent Apple Silicon like A13 Bionic has both high-performance cores (P cores) and high-efficiency cores (E cores). These different core types allow you to deliver apps that have both great performance and great battery life. To take full advantage of their performance and efficiency, you can provide the operating system (OS) with information about how to execute your app in the most optimal way. From there, the OS uses semantic information to make better scheduling and performance control decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore some best practices to help you get the most out of Apple Silicon and create faster, more efficient apps. Discover how to adapt your code for asymmetric multiprocessing, adopt Quality of Service classes, and find out more about Grand Central Dispatch APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adapt your code for asymmetric multiprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems which use many identical cores, asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) systems have cores that are not all equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Silicon Macs are AMP systems, having both performance cores (P cores) and efficiency cores (E cores). Even though E cores are optimized for high efficiency, they offer significant compute resources for apps to take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An app may execute threads on both P and E cores over a period of time. The OS places threads on P or E cores based on the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information your app provides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observation of the app’s workload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observation of the system as whole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Apple Silicon Macs, the system observes applications and daemons separately from each other. This allows the system to execute them with individual efficiency and performance characteristics. As an example, an app running in the background may have its threads placed on E cores to optimize battery life while the foreground app is taking advantage of P cores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Use Quality of Service classes to categorize work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality of Service (QoS) classes are the primary way for you to categorize work performed by your app and provide the OS with semantic information on the nature of that work and how it affects someone using your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On AMP systems, the operating system uses the energy-efficiency information conveyed by QoS classes to influence placement of threads on P or E cores. You can use the following QoS classes on Apple platforms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/9A85BC1B-B3AB-4F1C-97E7-49EDD69A6E51/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, you can use the QoS class Background to categorize all of your app’s background processes in order to maximize battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details on Quality of Service, watch “Building Responsive and Efficient Apps with GCD” from WWDC15 and explore the energy efficiency guide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statically pre-assigning pieces of a parallel workload to worker threads will leave threads idle before the end of the execution. This is because not all cores are equal and so worker threads will not make identical progress. Instead, subdivide parallel problems into a large number of pieces and use a work-stealing algorithm to balance these pieces across threads to keep all workers busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GCD&lt;/code&gt; is the recommended API for expressing concurrent and parallel workloads in your application. Parallel workloads should use the &lt;code&gt;concurrentPerform&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;dispatch_apply&lt;/code&gt; API to execute parallel instances of a block on multiple cores simultaneously. Set the number of iterations to at least three times the total number of cores on the system. This enables the work-stealing algorithm inside GCD to appropriately balance iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an existing codebase that cannot adopt GCD and uses a custom pthread worker pool, you may benefit from implementing a work-stealing algorithm to achieve optimal performance. For more information, see “Tuning Your Code’s Performance for Apple Silicon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Dispatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/tuning_your_code_s_performance_for_apple_silicon" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Tuning your code's performance for Apple Silicon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Further AMP exploration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you adopt GCD and QoS in your application, you can unlock greater processing power and ensure that your application performs well across all Apple platforms.

<title>Meet the new Apple Developer forums</title>

<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/261E420F-FFD8-4324-B5F2-2FDC583324F0/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re chatting with the community, asking questions, or getting clarifications from Apple engineers, the Apple Developer Forums are a great place to learn and share information about Apple platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forums have a ton of great content, and we want to help you get the most out of your visit. Check out some tips and tricks to discover how you can post like a pro, up your reputation, quickly find the best answers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Personalize your profile&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While anyone can view and browse the forums, you’ll need to sign in with your Apple ID if you want to ask or answer questions. Once you register, you can customize your profile with a preset avatar, add your location if you’re comfortable doing so, and share a link to one of your apps on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just follow a few simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign into your account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to your profile silhouette in the upper right corner of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click or tap on your silhouette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click or tap &lt;strong&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, you can change whatever you’d like to change, as well as choose to show information like how long you’ve been on the forums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tag, you’re it&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forums are organized by tags: When someone asks a new question, they can add up to four tags to help categorize their post. If you have a question about building watchOS apps with SwiftUI, for example, you might tag that post &lt;strong&gt;SwiftUI&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;watchOS&lt;/strong&gt;, and people searching either topic would get it in their search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tags are listed on every post in the forums: You can view all of the most recent questions filed under a given tag by clicking or tapping on it — as well as check out any relevant technical documentation or information for that tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/forums-tags" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;See all available tags on the forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Search swiftly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available on every forums page, the search bar lets you look for questions, tags, and profiles. You can supercharge your search queries with a few quick tips — here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyword search&lt;/strong&gt;
Type in a word that’s three characters or longer and hit return to get question titles or descriptions related to the word (or words) you’ve typed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tag search&lt;/strong&gt;
Want to search for a tag? Type it in brackets, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[mac]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This query will return information on tags with the word “mac” in them. Type in the name of a specific tag, and you’ll go straight to the tag’s landing page, which contains a brief description of the tag and a list of recently tagged questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combination searches&lt;/strong&gt;
If you know the name of a specific tag or multiple tags, you can combine them with a keyword to further refine your search. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[macOS][Beta] Catalyst&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This search will return all questions that have “Catalyst” in their title or description and are tagged with both “macOS” and “Beta.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a person&lt;/strong&gt;
Want to take a look at someone’s profile? Use the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;user:username&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replace “username” with the person’s username that you’re looking for to get a list of matching people (or, if you’ve entered an exact match, you’ll visit that person’s profile).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Quickly spot Apple Recommended answers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When browsing forum threads, you can use colors and shapes to quickly learn a bit more about that post. If using a mouse or trackpad, you can also hover your pointer over any box to get more information about that post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/548ECE61-FFBB-4D8C-ACF2-A43944D3522A/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Each question displays a color-coded square to indicate status. Blue squares are unsolved issues, green are solved, and green-bordered questions are solved with an Apple Recommended answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All unsolved questions appear with a &lt;strong&gt;blue&lt;/strong&gt; box to the left of the thread title, with the number of replies inside that box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a question has been marked “solved,” that box turns &lt;strong&gt;green&lt;/strong&gt;. And if an Apple Developer Forums admin has marked that answer “Apple Recommended,” the post’s green box gains a darker border around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip: Be a problem-solver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our community has a wealth of knowledge of both Apple platforms and products. If you spot a question on the forums that you think you can answer, you can reply to that post with your suggested solution. If it helps the author of the post, they can mark your answer as the solution to their problem, and you get reputation points for providing the best answer. If one of the Apple staff members agrees, they may promote your answer to Apple Recommended — netting you even more reputation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're viewing threads themselves, you can spot answers marked as Apple Recommended along the left side of the screen: They’re represented with a black circular icon with a white Apple logo inside of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rep your reputation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great community members are key to a great experience — and on the Apple Developer Forums, you can help your community surface important questions and earn reputation through constructive participation in threads. Moderators may review forum posts to ensure a safe and secure platform for you and other developers. Once a post has been approved, however, the community can rank and promote posts to the front page or top of a tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forums use a points-based system: Participating in threads and constructively providing answers can help you gain points and privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the perks you can gain on the forums for participating actively:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you solve problems, you get a “solved” badge on your profile that lists the number of questions you’ve solved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you provide a solution that admins mark as “Apple Recommended,” you receive an “Apple Recommended” badge on your profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can report posts for being duplicates or spam. (Requires at least 50 points reputation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can downvote questions or replies. (Requires at least 100 points reputation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gain points by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing a reply that gets marked as “Apple Recommended”: 25 points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing a reply that gets marked as "Solved" by the author: 15 points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking a question that gets upvoted: 5 points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing a reply that gets upvoted: 5 points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lose points by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having an upvote rescinded for your question or reply: -5 points (neutralizes the previous upvote)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing a question or reply that gets downvoted: -2 points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having spam or inappropriate/ abusive content that you posted removed: -15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Share replies within a post&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to link out to a forum thread in Messages, email, or elsewhere? You can share the original post or any reply by going to a thread and tapping or clicking on the Share button, found inline to the right of the post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Post like a pro&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to ask a question or share your thoughts? Here’s how to make your post look great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content is crucial&lt;/strong&gt;
When posting a question, consider what you can provide as background to help people understand your issue. Try to mention any limitations, assumptions, or simplifications. If you forget something or make a typo, you can edit your content for up to 15 minutes after posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tag it up&lt;/strong&gt;
You can add up to four tags to any post. Pick tags that relate directly to your question, and consider whether you’d want to see your post listed within that tag if it were being made by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark it down&lt;/strong&gt;
The forums take advantage of the Markdown language to quickly and easily style your text without cumbersome formatting, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordered lists, tasks, and unordered lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bold and italic text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code and syntax highlighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blockquotes, code, and text quotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attach a log&lt;/strong&gt;
If your post would benefit from attaching log content, click or tap on the attachment icon in the text editor. Add a title, paste your log content, and click Add Text. This text will be linked in the body of your post. (Note: Image attachments are not currently supported.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark as solved&lt;/strong&gt;
If someone provides you with a great answer on the thread, don’t forget to mark your question as solved by clicking or tapping on the checkmark icon next to the reply in question. You can only mark one reply as solved, and it can’t be unmarked. (You also can’t solve your own question.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Event excitement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At WWDC20, the forums are offering several event-specific tags to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone can view and read all WWDC-tagged posts. When you sign in with your Apple ID, you can also share your thoughts using the &lt;strong&gt;WWDC20 Community&lt;/strong&gt; tag or request help around conference logistics with the &lt;strong&gt;WWDC20 Support&lt;/strong&gt; tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you’ve been a member of the Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program since June 11, 2020 or you won the Swift Student Challenge, you can post on session-specific conference tags by signing in with the Apple ID associated with your developer account. Use these tags to ask questions about the technology within any given session and connect directly with Apple engineering teams.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have more thoughts on the forums? You can provide feedback by contacting Apple Developer Support or by creating a post and adding the &lt;strong&gt;Forums Feedback&lt;/strong&gt; tag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Visit the Apple Developer Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/forums/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Learn more about the Apple Developer Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>The developer’s guide to the Human Interface Guidelines</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=yyz8lqtw</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=yyz8lqtw</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/707766E0-F97F-42BF-93B1-3A3956D8C752/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Human Interface Guidelines — “HIG” for short — offers in-depth information and UI resources for all of Apple’s platforms, including specific technology areas. The HIG is full of information for designers that can help them create more compelling, intuitive, and beautiful experiences and design better apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re an engineer, the HIG can be equally useful as a guide during the entire development process. It offers a high-level and comprehensive view of key UI elements and associated APIs, and best practices to help you implement features into your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve put together a few common scenarios to show you how the HIG can help you throughout app design and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where to start&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HIG is organized by platforms and technologies, each with its own index. If you’ve never explored the HIG before, consider starting with the platform you’re currently developing for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/91F5A51B-A232-4F2F-B597-6F11D34517F6/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each platform is broken up into multiple sections that cover topics like app architecture, interaction, views, controls, and system capabilities. If you’d like to implement custom UI elements for your Apple Watch app, for example, you could reference the SpriteKit and SceneKit page of the System Capabilities section and gain perspective on some of the user experience considerations of implementing textured and 3D imagery in your app, as well as find a link to the WKInterfaceSCNScene and WKInterfaceSKScene framework over on the Developer Documentation website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;“I want to include a new UI element.”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HIG offers guidance for all interface elements, with a focus on the element’s intended use. When including any new piece of UI into your app, consider using the HIG to review how you should present the intended element on screen. Explore recommendations, learn about the rationale for styling, and understand the various ways in which you can achieve a presentation that expresses your brand and feels familiar to people who use your app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/495EDD2C-180E-45DB-B055-3994039F4D81/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for something as simple as adding a button to your interface, the HIG provides recommendations for how to place, label, and align it within your app — along with guidance on presenting and using these elements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;“I want to introduce a new feature into my app.”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Apple releases new features, you can often find additional insight and best practices around adoption within the HIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say that you add Augmented Reality (AR) content to your app. Inside the HIG, you can find information on AR interactions and address common problems with interface patterns. You can learn how to guide people into an AR experience, for example, or how people expect to interact with real and virtual content on screen. This guidance can also help you have discussions with your design and development teams as you plan out feature inclusion, and lead to better implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get started with Apple design elements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple’s ever-growing resources library makes it easy to explore the design side of our platforms. These downloads are great for prototyping concepts, finding specifications, and learning the language of design elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C4956C5B-2DC0-4C61-8B8D-DD3F6BB7ED21/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are templates and libraries for Adobe Photoshop, Adobe XD, Sketch, and Keynote, and each of these is filled with ready-to-use iOS UI elements — toolbars, tab bars, buttons, and much more. You can also explore resources like the SF Symbols app, which contains thousands of symbols in a wide range of weights and scales. These symbols integrate nicely with Xcode, they're simple to align with text labels, and they support accessibility features like Dynamic Type and Bold Text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The helpful HIG&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HIG is one of the best places you can start when you’re making design and engineering decisions about your app. It lays out the principles that define design across all Apple platforms, and it makes recommendations to help you anticipate and implement what most people want when using software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all, the HIG is continually updated to reflect changes and improvements across Apple’s platforms. So you can count on implementing features that keep pace with people’s evolving expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Human Interface Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Apple Design Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Learn more about SF Symbols&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>How to test your app on beta software</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=kdeag05s</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=kdeag05s</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/9BAD0578-940F-4633-8010-FA0F1637CFE4/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple regularly provides platform updates to add new features, fix bugs, and continue to improve the experience for everyone who uses our products. As part of that process, we offer beta software for developers as well as a Public Beta Software Program. This lets developers test apps on upcoming software, address pesky bugs, and provide information to engineering teams around upcoming software changes and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we encourage people to only install beta software on a secondary device, you may still find that some of your customers want to run your app while using a beta version of an operating system. Here are some of the ways to ensure your app’s stability for those people, get feedback from them, and provide some of your own to Apple’s engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Test early, test often&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When new beta software is released, we recommend downloading it as soon as possible to test with your existing apps. Not only is it an opportunity to ensure your app continues to work well, but it also puts you in a great position to experiment with our latest APIs and features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier you test, the earlier you can identify possible bugs or issues and flag them to Apple engineers. It’s also your best opportunity to register feedback around new features and influence future operating system updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Triage the trouble&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, changes to an API or operating system updates in an early beta may seriously affect your app. This is never a great feeling, but don’t panic! Chances are, many of your fellow developers are in the same boat. First, do a bit of triage to identify the problem. Is this a system issue, or a latent bug in your own code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To troubleshoot, isolate your issue by creating a minimally-reproducible case in a new Xcode project. When you only focus on the code that causes the bug, the problem can often be easier to find — and this also gives you a smaller project that you can share with others to troubleshoot or attach to a bug report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find that the beta has revealed an existing bug in your code, you may be able to fix it immediately and provide an update that makes your app more stable for both people on production as well as those running beta software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes you may be able to isolate the code in such a way that you can reproduce the issue on shipping software. If that’s the case, and if you need help fixing it, submit a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/technical/"&gt;Technical Support Incident&lt;/a&gt; for code-level support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there’s an issue with the beta itself that’s preventing you from providing a fix, it’s time to file some feedback. Even if you think others have filed this bug before, you should always send in a report: Your reproduction steps and data could be the key that unlocks the problem, or pushes the issue to a higher level of prioritization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vvrgkboh" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;How to file great bug reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst all the work you’re already doing on your app, you may be tempted to post a blanket statement to your website or within your app that you aren’t providing support for people who use beta software. We strongly discourage this approach: Your customers may be fellow developers or need to run beta software for another reason, and deterring them from running your app may make them feel shut out or lose trust in your software. Instead, if you’re running into a serious problem on a beta that may make for a sub-par experience that you haven’t been able to address in an update, consider sharing your issue on your website and social media channels, as well as the steps you’re taking to address it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Foster feedback&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though people running beta software on their devices can’t leave reviews for your app in the App Store, they still might have valuable feedback for you. Consider creating an easy way for your customers to provide bug reports — they may find something you’ve missed!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B6A4A139-C806-438D-9928-C186A25E20BE/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Consider offering a way for people to submit feedback or bug reports inside your app. Carrot Weather provides two options for people inside the app’s settings screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Connect with the community&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you struggling to fix an issue brought on by a beta update? Consider reaching out to our broader developer community and post to the Apple Developer Forums. Your question may be able to help others who may be struggling with similar challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=obvo7r3i" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Meet the new Apple Developer forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/welcome" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Explore the Apple Developer Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Future-proof your app&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of the beta release cycle, it’s worth taking a look at your project and any server-side code you maintain to see if there are ways you can improve and future-proof aspects of your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you fix or remove any additional warnings in your Xcode project?&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Enhance bug reports with debug profiles and logging</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=2o2p68bq</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=2o2p68bq</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F692F1DE-4747-4FB1-8C7B-26E3AE01EA25/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you file bug reports through Apple’s Feedback Assistant, you’re helping flag issues, improve our platforms, and make the experience better for developers and customers alike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can supply more information about bugs you come across when you provide a sysdiagnose from your device. Sysdiagnoses contain logs that include additional information gathered from apps and frameworks that you can submit as part of your bug report. They can be a crucial part of the bug-solving process, especially for troubleshooting certain problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, a sysdiagnose can contain a lot of information, and you can help the engineers triaging your issue by providing some additional context. That's where Apple’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/profiles-and-logs/"&gt;Profiles and Logs&lt;/a&gt; page comes in: It provides supplemental instructions when reporting an issue with specific frameworks. If you think you know which framework is causing the problem, read its bug reporting and logging instructions: You may be able to provide additional information that can help make your report more actionable — like detailing the song that was playing and the date and time you saw the bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/08604D72-E572-477C-A0E9-E5C2F22AAFFE/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Visit the Profiles and Logs section of the Apple Developer website to find out more about filing supplemental information for a bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a sysdiagnose is not enough, even with supplemental instruction. For those issues, debug profiles help capture specific details within a technology or framework that can aid engineers in diagnosing the problem. To install a debug profile, download it to your device and follow the instructions to capture the requested information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the next time you go to file a new piece of feedback, please add a sysdiagnose or logging generated from a debug profile to your report. It can help engineers begin tracking down even the trickiest of bugs, and it increases the likelihood of your issue being fixed. As always, the sooner you submit a new problem — and the more information you provide — the higher likelihood you have of getting it resolved in a future software version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially crucial when filing bugs against beta software, as prioritizations around fixes have to be made in early seeds. If you file a detailed bug with logs and a clear reproduction path, you have a much better chance of it being prioritized than a bug with no additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ywd3upss" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;File effective bug reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/profiles-and-logs/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Profiles and Logs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>How to file great bug reports</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vvrgkboh</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vvrgkboh</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/5A53F2BA-53C6-45BB-869D-48FCD5DA01A3/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bugs are an inevitable part of the development process. Though they can be frustrating to bump up against, you can help squash these sorts of problems quickly by identifying the issue you’re running into, reproducing it, and filing a bug report. At Apple, we provide an app and website called &lt;a href="http://feedbackassistant.apple.com"&gt;Feedback Assistant&lt;/a&gt; for logging issues with Apple’s products or software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should always file feedback for any bugs you find while developing on Apple’s platforms; after all, we can’t fix problems that we don’t know about. But how can you be sure that the information you provide is helpful for triaging the issue, rather than a bug-solving dead end? Here are some of our top tips for making sure your bug report is clear, actionable, and — most importantly — fixable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step by step&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever you log a new bug report, be clear and descriptive. Whether you’re providing specific feedback around a bug you’re running into or general feedback, describe your issue in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starts with a clear title that describes both the issue and the inciting factor. “Calendar events are missing” tells the screener that there’s an issue with Calendar events, but not how or why. In contrast, “Calendar events on macOS 10.15.4 are missing after creating a quick event” provides more detail at a glance and potentially helps identify duplicate bugs sooner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip: It’s often helpful for bug screeners to understand how issues are affecting app development. If you identify a problem while developing your app, include the name and version of your app in both the title and description field — even if you can reproduce the problem in a sample project — and add a link to your App Store record or a TestFlight build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing up your problem, describe each step thoroughly — it’s often helpful to pretend that whoever reads it has never seen the app or system you’re writing about before. For example, if you were to write “When I create an event in Calendar, it disappears in a moment,” the screener lacks enough detail to reproduce the issue. Are you creating a Calendar event through the Quick Event button, or are you dragging to add a new event? How long is a moment? Did the event disappear after multitasking, or did you remain in the app? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a bug screener has to pause and consider this kind of question, it reduces the likelihood that your problem can get fixed quickly. Instead, think about ways you can describe your bug in detail, like so: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Click Quick Event button in the Calendar app.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;2. Fill out an event with any title.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;3. Hit Return.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Actual Results: The event appears in the right place in my calendar but then disappears.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expected Results: The Calendar event should appear and stay on my calendar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After filling out your reproduction steps and expected result, it’s also worth considering additional factors that could influence the problem. Are you signed into iCloud? Do you have any Accessibility settings turned on? Does the issue reproduce in a similar fashion in other places around the OS? The more questions you can answer in the initial report, the faster someone reading it can triage it effectively and get it over to the right team or person for a fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Add some visuals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can reproduce the bug and capture video or a screenshot while it’s happening, this information can be invaluable to people for troubleshooting the issue. A screen recording can also help capture details that you may not have thought to provide in the description field. If your problem involves an issue with the UI, you should always include visuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Log the crash&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not all bugs are reproducible or have easy-to-follow steps. For trickier cases, consider providing logging information like a sysdiagnose: If you’re filing a bug on your iPhone or iPad, you can use the Feedback Assistant app to capture one automatically. If filing a bug via Apple’s web portal, you can install profiles that can help you manually gather a sysdiagnose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also provide any additional logging relevant to the issue. For example, if you’re experiencing a crash, you can include your app’s crash logs. If you’re reporting a performance regression, you can include an Instruments Trace on iOS or iPadOS, or a Sample on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=2o2p68bq" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Enhance bug reports with debug profiles and logging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create a sample project&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running into an issue while developing an app? Consider isolating the problem into a small sample project that compiles. Not only can it help you narrow down the specific bug you’re facing, but it’s one of the easiest ways for Apple’s bug screeners and engineers to triage the offending problem. If you can’t produce a sample project, sample code is also helpful — any additional information that can help narrow down the issue is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Escalate your report&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a paid member of the Apple Developer Program, Enterprise Program, or MFi Program and you’re having a technical issue with one of Apple’s platforms on a production release, you should consider filing a Technical Support Incident. This is a request for code-level support for Apple frameworks, APIs, and tools when you cannot fix a bug, have trouble implementing a specific technology, or have other questions about your code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/technical/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Request technical support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Learn more about Feedback Assistant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/privacy" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright"&gt;Learn more about our privacy policy when filing bugs with Feedback Assistant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Meet the developer: Christopher Gray</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=9cvnv50x</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=9cvnv50x</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/0B0CF5DF-678E-4FE1-95DA-7B1E66CE48CE/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;How Christopher Gray’s app, Scholly, helps kids go to college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a teenager in Alabama, Christopher Gray was a straight-A student, community volunteer, and relentless dreamer. He was also the son of a single mother who’d lost her job to the recession. At times during his high school years, they were homeless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With graduation looming, Gray came to see college as a necessity, but one priced like a luxury item. Lacking internet access at home, he searched for scholarships at the library, one hour at a time, in keeping with the posted screen limits. He often wrote 500-word application essays on his phone — not a smartphone but a chunky 2008 model with a tiny keyboard. He did this for seven months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I saw a problem and I tried to fix it,” he says from a Hollywood office populated by a handful of coworkers and one very large dog named Milk. “My grandma always told me, ‘You have to work. You have to ignore whatever is going on around you, put your head down, and focus.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When his first scholarship check arrived, he sensed his efforts paying off. By the time the last one came in, Gray had amassed $1.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He used the money to study finance and entrepreneurship at Drexel University (and to cover his living expenses for all four years). But the process nagged at him. How, he thought, could it be so disjointed? How many students had it discouraged from going or even applying to college?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I realized there’s all this money looking for students,” he says, “and all these students looking for money.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Scholly. Founded at Drexel by Gray and fellow students Nick Pirollo and Bryson Alef, it launched in 2015 with the simple goal of matching students with available scholarships: Input your age, interests, and other demographic information and Scholly would find potential fits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/02CF36D1-E2DD-460F-9843-E62E663F9ECA/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;No matter what your interests are, Scholly can help find money to support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea, Gray says, was born from his desire to help others do what he did. “I got some scholarships because I was the only one who applied. A lot of times, students just don’t know they exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More good news was to come. His story soon reached the producers of Shark Tank, and the rest is Scholly history: Gray’s 60-second pitch resulted in a near-instant deal with Lori Greiner and Daymond John—and some viral offscreen dramatics. (Greiner offered Gray his requested $40,000 without even asking questions. “I don’t care how we monetize,” she said, prompting a minor meltdown in which a number of sharks basically stormed out of the studio.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realized there’s all this money looking for students, and all these students looking for money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scholly Search is the classic example of a simple idea that exploded. Today, it has roughly 3 million users who have landed more than $110 million in scholarships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actor and activist Jesse Williams is a member of Scholly Search’s board; Chance the Rapper has appeared at its Chicago-based initiatives. The company has relocated from Philadelphia to California, into a sprawling corner office with mountain views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The amounts are compelling,” Gray says, “but what’s just as powerful are the stories of people who get, like, the last $3,000 they need to enroll. I always wear my Scholly sweatshirt when I travel, and people come up to me and say, ‘Oh wow, you’re Scholly!’ Not ‘Oh, you’re Chris’ but ‘You’re Scholly!’ And they’ll tell me their story. It’s really powerful to experience that, because, OK, I was a homeless kid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still in his midtwenties, Gray has been named to Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list for social entrepreneurship and Oprah Winfrey’s “SuperSoul 100” (who are basically her favorite people). He’s spoken at the Obama Foundation’s My Brother’s Keeper summit and received the 2018 Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B931104E-0CDE-4C7F-9103-51E90E24146E/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Christopher Gray’s work got the attention of Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and Jesse Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Gray has set about evolving Scholly into a full-service education app. Scholly Math is an AI-powered standalone app that helps students solve tricky problems (while showing its work, of course). There’s also Scholly Editor, a web-based proofreader. “We originally created it to help with essays,” Gray says, “but a lot of kids are using it to get better grades and learn English, especially in underserved schools.”   Mostly, he hopes to continue helping students reach dreams that circumstances might have once deemed impossible.   “This good thing happened to me,” he says, “and now maybe I can help people who otherwise may not be able to help themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Meet the developer: Shine</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=iqeu33mh</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=iqeu33mh</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/467E4D0D-435A-4678-AA39-FB8116DE3BB4/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The secret of their self-care app’s success? Staying authentic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before creating &lt;em&gt;Shine&lt;/em&gt;, a self-care app that encourages you to “accept who you are today,” co-CEOs Marah Lidey and Naomi Hirabayashi set a few ground rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not going to assume you’re working,” says Lidey. “We’re not going to assume you have or don’t have kids or that you want kids. We’re not going to assume anything about your gender.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that felt “preachy, pricey, or presumptuous” was off the table too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That foundation worked. More than 4 million users have signed up for &lt;em&gt;Shine&lt;/em&gt;, with nearly one in three reviews describing the app as “life-changing,” according to Hirabayashi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/9069CAB4-2515-4B4E-ACD4-D04E864C1B1D/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Shine co-CEO Marah Lidey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do Lidey and Hirabayashi know their audience so well? They’re part of it — and have been for a long time.  The duo met in 2011 while executives at &lt;em&gt;DoSomething.org&lt;/em&gt;, a nonprofit that helps young people transform their communities. The two started getting coffee, then lunch, then after-work drinks, creating what Lidey calls a “safe space to process the tough stuff.”   Over time, they came to see the “tough stuff” in a new light. “What we were going through wasn’t weird — it was human,” says Lidey.  Shine grew out of their desire to make that safe space bigger, to help others with issues ranging from building a credit score to dealing with giving feedback to employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/68535756-CCBF-4F94-BCCC-63B2C57190B8/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Check in with Shine via its chat interface and the app will serve up articles based on your responses (front). Check out the app’s Quick Hitters for talks tailored to different times of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app launched in 2018 as an “accessible but aspirational” text-based coaching program. Its tone is chatty and friendly, like “the friend that has a psych degree,” says Hirabayashi. (Shine’s actual psych cred comes from therapist and corporate coach Anna Rowley, who helped develop the curriculum.) Using a chat-based interface, the app helps you see how you see yourself. (Hirabayashi, for her part, is a “Caring Critic” prone to “extending compassion outward, but often struggling to bring that compassion home,” she says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4116B84D-F165-4100-B0A1-D6E98426BC15/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Shine co-CEO Naomi Hirabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the app is rich with features. &lt;em&gt;The Daily Shine&lt;/em&gt; is a podcast that Hirabayashi describes as a “secular sermon.” Challenges are short, multiday audio courses on specific goals like “Be More Direct” and “Let Yourself Have More Fun.” “Nightcap” is a collection of sleep stories that double as winking retellings of 2000s rom-coms (“The Devil Wears Pajamas”). “They’re meant to be boring and also a little cheeky,” Lidey says.  Through all the growth, the pair’s goal has remained the same. The idea isn’t to solve every problem, but to adjust how people approach them, says Hirabayashi. “What’s beautiful is that the pressure is to be authentic, not perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Meet the developer: Andre Haddad</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=afevex77</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=afevex77</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/FC1411E9-E930-43C5-8780-C2FA94B1D068/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Once a refugee, Haddad now runs the high-end car-rental app Turo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago, &lt;em&gt;Turo&lt;/em&gt; CEO Andre Haddad was in a parking garage beneath his family’s apartment building in Beirut, listening for the bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 1989, the last of the 15-year Lebanese civil war, and the two dozen families living in Haddad’s eight-story building often spent their nights huddled in the relative safety of the underground garage. Although just big enough for six cars at most, it had become a shelter, strewn with mattresses and lamps and personal items brought down from the apartments above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You build up kind of a war wisdom over time: You don’t want to be on the top floors of your building,” Haddad says. “And a lot of the shooting would happen at night, so you’d try to sleep in the garage, hearing the shelling and building shaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His family lived like this for more than a year, until the night the shells found their apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haddad is recounting his story in downtown San Francisco at the offices of his car-sharing app &lt;em&gt;Turo&lt;/em&gt;, which that lets people rent out their (often very fancy) cars by the day. Want to drive a Lamborghini? Or take a BMW convertible from Vegas to the Bay Area? All doable. Today, &lt;em&gt;Turo&lt;/em&gt; has more than 14 million members and 450,000 registered vehicles. Haddad’s road to get here crossed many borders, but it started that night in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/2F486A03-D982-406C-A6AF-C1FEA1A97CF8/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;*Turo* makes it possible to rent the kind of cars that you’d normally associate with spy movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bomb hit, things moved fast. Haddad’s family decided to to leave Lebanon and stay with relatives in Cyprus, but Haddad took a different path. Prior to the blast he’d been chatting with a cousin in Paris, one who’d asked him a question he’d never considered. “He said, ‘It’s your senior year of high school, what are your plans? What do you want to do?’” Haddad said. “I thought, wow, nobody’s asked me those questions. When you’re in those conditions, there’s not much of a vision for the future. It’s a mechanism of self-defense.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after the shell landed on his balcony, Haddad called that cousin, and before long he had a ticket to Paris and a plan to get into business school. Seventeen years old and on his own, Haddad also found his way into the French music scene and became a DJ — he claims to have seen Daft Punk before the helmets — but there was a problem: His music had all been obliterated in the blast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/54AD7979-F456-4339-BFCB-6A5E517300F4/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Haddad, a former DJ in Paris, keeps a well-stocked music collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was looking for ways to rebuild my collection,” he says, “and I discovered eBay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selection was incredible, but the more he bought, the more he wanted to sell — and the shipping charges were piling up fast. To address both problems —and using his speedily developing business instincts — he founded &lt;em&gt;iBazar&lt;/em&gt;, which launched as a way to swap music and became one of Europe’s largest online marketplaces. &lt;em&gt;iBazar&lt;/em&gt; grew large enough that it was eventually purchased by &lt;em&gt;eBay&lt;/em&gt; for more than $100 million. Just like that, everything had changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haddad spent the next decade in tech jobs, occupying positions with &lt;em&gt;eBay&lt;/em&gt; and serving as CEO of &lt;em&gt;Shopping.com&lt;/em&gt;. In 2011, ground down by the workload, he was planning on taking a sabbatical when a friend approached him about a car-sharing idea called &lt;em&gt;Turo&lt;/em&gt;. “I got to really appreciate the creativity, the scrappiness, the hunger,” he says. Plus, he was well familiar with the notion of using the internet to connect real people. “Turo was built on trust, which made me feel very comfortable with it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an incredible highlight to see the power of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Andre Haddad&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;em&gt;Turo&lt;/em&gt; has more than 14 million members. “There are users who are barely 18, and some in their 80s,” he says. The app offers everything from standard sedans to exotic high-end imports, often for less than the price of a traditional rental. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, after some initial hesitation, Haddad has become more vocal about immigration issues. “At first, I didn’t want any public involvement with this kind of noble cause to be misinterpreted as personal publicity — or even worse, corporate publicity,” he says. Plus, he adds, it hadn’t been easy to turn the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, he’s becoming more and more outspoken, both out loud and in writing. He’s spent years on the board of Immigration Equality, an organization designed to bring equality to LGBTQ+ immigrants. And he’s signed amicus briefs and open letters aimed at protecting immigrants. “It’s the right thing to do,” he says. “It helps the economic development of the United States. But the fact is, people are here because they chose to come here. It’s a very, very hard thing to do. If you’re willing to do that, it means there’s some exceptional traits of character.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Meet the creative: Chelsa Lauderdale</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=kwypl7k1</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=kwypl7k1</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/6FF8FA71-7BFE-48A8-AEB5-A607AAFDDD90/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writer Chelsa Lauderdale was creating characters for “The Elementalists,” an interactive story in the game &lt;em&gt;Choices&lt;/em&gt;, she wanted one in particular to have it all: great looks, enviable talent, a heart of gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, everything you’d want in a potential love interest who also happens to be a wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauderdale imbued him with real depth. As a student at a university for the magically gifted, Griffin Langley may be able to cast spells, but as a black man he struggles with expectations of his race and gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B105142D-384B-416B-9E28-C84FE9F1F33D/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The more time you spend with Griffin, the more he opens up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all part of her writing process with &lt;em&gt;Choices&lt;/em&gt;. “One of the first things we asked ourselves was: What communities are we underserving?” Lauderdale says. “What can we do to make sure people see themselves in this?“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she started the job, she was unsure how far to push the stories, which present players with different narrative options and let them choose how everything unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had recently decided to cut her hair short and grow out what she calls her “baby Afro” after a conflicted relationship with straighteners and dyes. “I remember asking if it was OK to include a story line about how a character learned to love her natural hair,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There used to be this idea that black men shouldn't show weakness. That can be a tremendous weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team embraced the idea. “Since then I’ve tried to insert little pieces of my experience,” she says.  To Chelsa, Griffin brings many people’s real-world experiences to virtual life—and offers an alternative to how black men are usually portrayed in games.   “There used to be this idea that black men should be hard, they shouldn't show weakness. That can be a tremendous weight on people's mental health and on their relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A05F3EC9-2F15-420F-893D-6576BB565F38/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Lauderdale started her career early. “I got a writing assignment in the fourth grade and haven’t really stopped since then,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffin is the first character to greet you when you arrive at the magical university, and he warmly takes you under his wing. Over the course of your courtship, he gradually reveals his struggles, and together you tackle identity issues head-on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s torn between his tough appearance and sweet personality, his parents’ wants and his own,” she says. “I think this is a common feeling within the black community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories can perpetuate stereotypes or they can change narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chelsa is writing more &lt;em&gt;Choices&lt;/em&gt; stories about identity — as well as young-adult fiction that explores female friendship and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stories can perpetuate stereotypes or they can change narratives,” she says. “That's really up to the people who write them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Meet the developer: Kaya Thomas</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=3b2glyjr</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=3b2glyjr</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/75DC51F7-208F-4B14-82D8-E1BF69A71364/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Kaya Thomas’ We Read Too spotlights writers and characters of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaya Thomas has always been a voracious reader, yet growing up she rarely came across protagonists who looked like her. “High school was when I started to realize that none of the characters were ever black girls,” Thomas says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inspired her to code &lt;em&gt;We Read Too&lt;/em&gt;, an app that helps you find children’s books by writers of color, featuring characters of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B33998E5-62A3-4F16-BC01-A71DFA8B905E/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;We Read Too has become one of the most comprehensive catalogs of children’s books by writers of color, featuring characters of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas, a Dartmouth graduate, now lives in Oakland and works as an iOS engineer at Calm. She still remembers creating a new document on her computer and writing the list that would eventually become &lt;em&gt;We Read Too&lt;/em&gt;.   “The app looks much different today than it did in 2014,” she laughs. In its current version, you can browse by category (picture, chapter, middle grades, young adult) and search by title or author. There are currently over 900 books cataloged in the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;High school was when I started to realize that none of the characters were ever black girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it stands, &lt;em&gt;We Read Too&lt;/em&gt; is a labor of love. Anyone can download it for free, and Thomas is dedicated to keeping it that way. “I wanted &lt;em&gt;We Read Too&lt;/em&gt; to be accessible to everyone, regardless of whether they could afford to buy a $1 app,” she says. “I have no intention of ever charging anyone for access to the information.”  Although Thomas hasn’t earned any money from the app, it has paid off in other ways.  “&lt;em&gt;We Read Too&lt;/em&gt; helped me build my network and connections, and gain the courage to move out to California and get into the tech industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/3E306387-8F9D-4136-ADC5-A798056444BF/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Kaya Thomas is an iOS engineer at Calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how she’d like to see &lt;em&gt;We Read Too&lt;/em&gt; expand, Thomas says it’s all about community: “First and foremost, I want to make sure that there are as many titles in the app as possible.” And she hopes to partner with libraries to integrate with their cataloging systems, since this is where many kids and teens get their books.   Thomas also has a few words of advice for coders of all backgrounds.   “Don’t let anyone discourage you. You have to realize that you are 100 percent capable of learning the skills,” she says. “There’s no one person who is supposed to be a coder. You are completely capable, and don’t let anyone say you’re not because of who you are.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Meet the Developer: David Niemeijer</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=15u3zxkk</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=15u3zxkk</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/200D3575-A203-42A5-A03E-7412EE4E3BAC/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1995, Giesbert Nijhuis was touring through Europe with his ska-reggae band when his van tumbled off the road. The accident left Nijhuis paralyzed from the neck down. He was 26 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t move anything except for my head, and only had an eighth of my normal breathing capacity. There was almost no hope of healing or repairing the spinal cord,” says Nijhuis, a professional graphic designer and photographer. “At first I was questioning if I wanted to continue life like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Niemeijer, a friend of Nijhuis’ since childhood, remembers that dark time well. “His new physical challenges drained the life right out of him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/6EF977AD-5A23-495C-BDAB-F8929292E72E/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Giesbert Nijhuis (top) inspired his friend David Niemeijer to create AssistiveWare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accident affected every part of Nijhuis’ life, including his very livelihood. To edit images on his Mac, he needed to be able to enter key combinations, but the assistive onscreen keyboards available then didn’t allow for that. In his new situation—or his “second life,” as he likes to call it—he was facing serious accessibility issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Niemeijer, who has a degree in agricultural and environmental sciences and was working at a university at the time, created his own assistive keyboard—what would become the Mac app &lt;em&gt;Keystrokes&lt;/em&gt;. He soon scaled back his work at the university to focus on founding a software company, AssistiveWare, which released a number of pioneering accessibility tools for the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then came the launch of iOS, which changed everything for Niemeijer by untethering assistive software from the computer. In 2009, just a year after the iOS Software Development Kit launched, AssistiveWare released its breakthrough product: &lt;em&gt;Proloquo2Go&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/89685241-78D2-4F01-828E-A2C994CBCBD5/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;*Proloquo2Go* is a symbol-based keyboard to aid people with difficulties in speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proloquo2Go&lt;/em&gt; gives a voice to those who have difficulty speaking (proloquo is Latin for “to speak out loud”). Paired with an iPhone or iPad, it also made this assistive technology more widely available. “It enables people to start learning to use it much earlier. It used to be that you’d get an expensive machine when you were 7 or 8 years old,” says Niemeijer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With an iPad or iPod touch, you can start around 2 or 3 years old, which makes a huge difference, because some kids then can go to regular schools and are not reliant on special education.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proloquo2Go&lt;/em&gt; presents a variety of simple drawings; tap them to create sentences that the app will read aloud. Instead of providing only a limited number of predetermined sentences and phrases, &lt;em&gt;Proloquo2Go&lt;/em&gt; lets you combine words in infinite ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It offers users total communication,” says Niemeijer. “It allows people to not just use utilitarian language, such as asking or answering questions, but also to share stories or emotional anecdotes. It allows them to tell a joke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AssistiveWare currently has a half dozen apps available across iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. &lt;em&gt;Pictello&lt;/em&gt; lets users create storybooks using text-to-speech and the photos on their iOS device. &lt;em&gt;Keeble&lt;/em&gt; is a highly customizable keyboard app that supports users with motor challenges, low vision, and dyslexia. And &lt;em&gt;News-2-You&lt;/em&gt; publishes a weekly newspaper, written with both text and symbols, for beginning readers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nijhuis is proud of what Niemeijer has managed to build. “I love having seen David’s works grow from the software he made just for me to the company it is today, serving so many people all over the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designer continues to influence AssistiveWare’s evolution: He created the company logo and the app icon for &lt;em&gt;Proloquo2Go&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>How to design an accessible Apple Watch app</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1gzanw45</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1gzanw45</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/890D50EB-A43A-4C1A-8FF2-0919A9ADC3E9/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Watch is built with accessibility in mind, empowering everyone to use their device in the way that suits them best — and your Apple Watch app can take advantage of all these features to create a seamless and inclusive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re designing your Apple Watch app, here are a few considerations to take into account to make it accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Responsive, responsible reviews&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to get a picture of the work you need to do is to explore Apple Watch’s accessibility and display options: These allow people to adjust or augment their interface and interactions with Apple Watch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/522672F5-6313-4D44-8B5C-061819DC37D2/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;You can access accessibility and text settings on Apple Watch or through the Watch app on iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When designing your app, Dynamic Type and VoiceOver are two core settings worth exploring: Dynamic Type allows people to change the size of their text on Apple Watch, while VoiceOver helps people navigate without having to view the screen. You can enable or adjust either in the Settings app or on your iPhone’s Watch app at any time. 
 We recommend testing your Watch app with these options enabled to make sure your app is fully accessible. You may also want to consider testing your interface with Bold Text, Reduce Transparency, and Reduce Motion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each test you run, ask yourself a few questions: How does your interface change? Are there aspects of your design that are no longer being well-represented? Take detailed notes and screenshots — these can help you go back and address potential issues in both your designs and your app’s Xcode project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scale up, scale down&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with other Apple products, the small size of an Apple Watch display means far less space for presenting text. As such, it can be tempting to consider specifying fixed smaller font sizes so that more text can be shown on screen at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, it’s important to use legible font sizes and support Dynamic Type. Displaying more text on screen, while helpful in principle, won’t help anyone if it’s too small to read. Instead, let text scale naturally, and use Apple Watch’s swipe gestures or rotate the Digital Crown to read longer text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A963C9F9-AEC9-4ACB-999B-7ED2A1B7D29D/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;In watchOS 5, four large type sizes were added to the built-in styles on Apple Watch. Each column in this table is manifested as a type size option, which people can set on Apple Watch in **Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Text Size**. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quickest way to support Dynamic Type and text scaling is to use built-in text styles, which set type using Apple Watch’s system font: SF Compact. This font is specifically designed for optimal legibility at small sizes, offering nine built-in styles in a range of sizes and weights to help make text in your app as readable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, all text in your app should scale appropriately when people adjust their text size. Fixed text sizes should be used only for information that is clearly legible at its default setting. For example, the Podcasts app uses built-in text styles to display the podcast title at a consistently large size, and enables its smaller text elements to scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/03ECC669-0B59-4702-A8E3-1126B7291D26/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;When text is set to the smallest size, the Podcasts app displays two full episode rows on a 44mm Apple Watch. At the largest size, there are fewer rows displayed but the episode title, date and duration are much larger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you plan to use a custom font within your app, you’ll need to take a few additional steps to ensure that it works with Dynamic Type, including adding the font to your project and configuring text styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/text_display_and_fonts/adding_a_custom_font_to_your_app"&gt;Learn more about adding custom&amp;nbsp;fonts&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You can add support for VoiceOver in your app with accessibility labels, which help people using the feature understand how your interface is constructed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun fact: If you want to quickly test VoiceOver in your app, you can use Siri. Just enable Siri and ask it to “Turn on VoiceOver.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone looks at your interface on Apple Watch, your app can rely on common visual paradigms like button shapes and lists to communicate information and actions. For VoiceOver, think about how you might translate that experience to someone hearing the interface of your app: Start by designating a clear reading order of your interface elements, and make sure that you label your interface elements with brief and clear descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s one more step to consider when implementing VoiceOver: Your audience may want to hear your interface in another language. VoiceOver supports more than 35 languages, and you can make sure your app is ready for use in all of them by localizing your text strings so that all accessibility labels and hints are read in the appropriate language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=v56qu1b3"&gt;Learn more about crafting a great VoiceOver experience in your app &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For everything you create, it’s worth taking the time to test your app and make any adjustments. Whether you’re adding scalable text or incorporating a better VoiceOver experience, these changes have a big impact on people who need or want accessibility features on Apple Watch, and they’ll likely also help you craft better overall designs for everyone who enjoys your app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility/overview/introduction/"&gt;Learn more about designing with accessibility in&amp;nbsp;mind&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Take this article, for instance: You may be reading this text visually; however, if you’re a developer who uses VoiceOver, you’ll hear this paragraph (and the rest of the article) spoken to you along with verbal descriptions of any important elements you might need to know about. And if you’ve opened this article in the Developer app, you’ll also hear about navigational elements in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you personally use VoiceOver or not, here’s how you can put yourself in the mindset of those who do to help design a standout experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Master accessibility elements in your app&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone enables VoiceOver on iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, or tvOS, it begins describing all of the labeled elements on screen. To decide what to read, VoiceOver looks for accessibility elements — individual or grouped visual elements within a view — as well as whether someone can interact with these elements. As it describes an element, VoiceOver also highlights it on screen by displaying a black rectangle around the content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip: Explore VoiceOver on your own device&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While Xcode provides you with several tools to test your app’s accessibility, you can learn a lot about VoiceOver and how various apps have implemented it by taking a test drive on your own iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, or Apple TV. You can enable VoiceOver in the Settings app or System Preferences on your Mac, and if you want to have easy access to the feature, you can even enable a hardware-based Accessibility&amp;nbsp;Shortcut.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;VoiceOver also adds a few specific multitouch gestures and taps to help people navigate their device. Swiping to the right anywhere on the screen will navigate to the next element in the view, while swiping to the left will navigate to the previous one. Each time VoiceOver lands on a new element, it speaks details like its accessibility label and value aloud, along with hints or traits if the element has any. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, people may tap directly on a visual element to navigate to it. If it’s within the bounds of an accessibility element, VoiceOver will focus on it. Otherwise, VoiceOver will emit a “boink” sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, all standard UIKit controls are accessibility elements. To flag a custom control or view as an accessibility element, you can use &lt;code&gt;isAccessibilityElement&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="code-source"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; isAccessibilityElement: &lt;span class="syntax-type"&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615141-isaccessibilityelement"&gt;Learn more about accessibility&amp;nbsp;elements&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Group and declutter accessibility elements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When navigating by swiping, VoiceOver visits each element in order of its appearance on the screen. That said, this isn’t always the most efficient way for someone to absorb information: If your app has too many accessibility elements, it may take someone a very long time to understand it. Instead, look for opportunities to group your accessibility elements together and create a simplified hierarchy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you group your accessibility elements, VoiceOver will describe them together, which can speed up navigation through your app. For example, you might group a view that contains a title, text, and a time stamp label, as with Health’s Heart Rate title, heartbeat reading, and time of latest reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/6954D51F-116E-43BC-ACC5-967FD8EC4DF3/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The Health app uses grouped elements in the Summary view to provide a streamlined experience for people using VoiceOver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also helps provide context for someone using VoiceOver that would otherwise be present in a visual interface: By grouping them and having them read together, this lets people know that the time and text are associated with the title, rather than three unrelated items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Add custom actions &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can assign any accessibility element custom actions, which provides extra functionality. For example, if you use Mail without VoiceOver enabled, you can tap on a message inside the inbox to view it, but you can also swipe left or right on an individual message to access other features like deleting, flagging, or moving a message. Custom actions let people who use VoiceOver have access to those same features in a different manner: When VoiceOver focuses on the message element, it speaks the hint “Actions Available: Swipe up or down to select a custom action.” Once you arrive at the action you want, you can double-tap to perform it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun fact: When you implement leading or trailing table view swipe gestures in your app, you automatically get VoiceOver actions for these buttons in your project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Custom actions are very powerful when combined with grouped elements and can help simplify your navigable hierarchy. If you have a view as an accessibility element that has multiple buttons as subviews, for example, you aren’t always able to navigate to those buttons with VoiceOver. While it might be tempting to break up this up into smaller elements and allow buttons to become individually focusable, this may add clutter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We strongly recommend using Custom Actions to expose these button actions, letting you keep the element’s organization while still providing full controls to someone using VoiceOver.  When you carefully group your elements and add custom actions, it creates a better overall navigation experience and will make your app far more enjoyable for people who rely on VoiceOver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set a &lt;code&gt;UIAccessibilityCustomAction&lt;/code&gt; on your accessibility elements, you can use &lt;code&gt;accessibilityCustomActions&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="code-source"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; accessibilityCustomActions: [&lt;span class="syntax-type"&gt;UIAccessibilityCustomAction&lt;/span&gt;]? { &lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilitycustomaction"&gt;Learn more about custom&amp;nbsp;actions&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Flag layout changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your app may change its layout visually to indicate the result of an action or event. In the Shortcuts app, for example, tapping the + button brings up components that will help someone build a shortcut. For people who use VoiceOver, you can use the “screen changed” or “layout changed” notifications to guide their focus to the new elements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/EDD3C039-FA6C-440D-AF32-CE6C8F0C0849/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The Shortcuts app plays a “screen changed” notification after someone selects the + button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best to use “layout changed” only when there’s a major change to your interface, as pulling focus too often can make people confused and lose context inside your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To post an accessibility notification, you can use &lt;code&gt;post(notification:argument:)&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;UIAccessibility&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="code-source"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="syntax-function"&gt;&lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="syntax-title"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="syntax-params"&gt;(notification: UIAccessibility.Notification, 
        argument: &lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;Any&lt;/span&gt;?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibility/1615194-post"&gt;Learn more about accessibility&amp;nbsp;notifications&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Next steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you make these improvements to your app, you’re not only unlocking better VoiceOver support, you’re also laying the groundwork for our other assistive technologies like Switch Control and Full Keyboard Access.

<title>Meet the developer: Craig Hockenberry</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6qwc01iu</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6qwc01iu</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/2EC8472C-149D-413F-81AD-811CFE653565/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Get to know the influential creator of Twitterrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a while for Craig Hockenberry, principal at The Iconfactory, to realize his true calling. Although he began coding when he was 16, in 1976 (the same year the Apple I was released) his career took a detour into corporate management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We originally made &lt;em&gt;Twitterrific&lt;/em&gt; because all the folks at the Iconfactory wanted an easier way to follow what our friends and colleagues were doing,” said Hockenberry. "&lt;em&gt;xScope&lt;/em&gt; is another product in the same vein—we built it because we needed it. We’re our own best customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4E29F7B1-E651-4BC3-A860-308BC0D51DBB/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;*Twitterrific*’s multipane view color-codes tweets by category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To say Hockenberry has been ahead of the curve over the course of his storied career is an understatement. &lt;em&gt;Twitterrific&lt;/em&gt;, released over a decade ago, was the very first &lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt; client for Mac. Hockenberry even helped coin the term “tweet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know the signature blue bird everyone associates with the social network? Hockenberry created the first one: an icon he named Ollie. (&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt; later followed suit with its own variation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the apps Hockenberry has worked on are designed for a diverse range of customers, the philosophy behind them has remained the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When we create a new app, we’re always thinking, ‘What problem does this solve for the customer?’” he says. For Hockenberry, functionality and design are equally important. “Functionality overcomes the problem, and design makes it approachable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C759C559-3F82-4CB6-847E-75DAB73F6C92/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;*xScope*’s overlay tools give you a sense of how graphics will appear to those with red-green color blindness and other visual impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask anyone in the community for a shortlist of the best developers and Hockenberry’s name inevitably comes up — no doubt because he’s been such an active and generous member. Iconfactory.com gives away about 2 terabytes of icons and wallpapers each month. Hockenberry also blogs about development at furbo.org, where he’s always willing to share his know-how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It’s something I learned from my dad — you need to help others in your community,” he says. “When I find something cool or have a unique insight, I love to share it with other developers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, he has no intention of slowing down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My grandfather always said, ‘You’re only as old as you act.’ If that’s the case, I’m still my younger self!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on the Mac App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>How to master multitasking and multiple windows for your iPad app</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=9nvbn1tp</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=9nvbn1tp</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/39B87033-83EE-46D1-828F-A99D6820A4C0/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multitasking is one of the many great features of iPadOS and gives people options and flexibility in how they want to interact with your app and others on iPad. They can browse your app in full screen, put it next to another app in Split View, pull it up in Slide Over, or even view multiple instances of your app side by side. Here are a few ways you can improve the look and feel of your iPad app for multitasking and multiple windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Make your app a multitasking master&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether your app is running by itself, in a Slide Over pane, or side by side in Split View, it should always support a great multitasking experience. People expect apps on iPad to seamlessly adjust between size classes as they add or remove apps on their screen. When you design an adaptive UI, you can ensure that your controls and views remain visible and useable, whether your app is full screen or displaying in a compact view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make your view controllers and views responsive to changes in the iOS interface environment, override the &lt;code&gt;traitCollectionDidChange(_:)&lt;/code&gt; method from the trait environment protocol. To customize view controller animations in response to interface environment changes, override the &lt;code&gt;willTransition(to:with:)&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code&gt;UIContentContainer&lt;/code&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitraitcollection"&gt;Learn more about UI trait&amp;nbsp;collections&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can further guarantee people a flexible, adaptive experience by using tools like Auto Layout and safe area insets to ensure your app looks great no matter how it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=nixcb564"&gt;Read more about how you can make your app look great on every&amp;nbsp;screen&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Multiply your windows&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting with iPadOS 13, you can add support for creating multiple instances of your app. When you support multiple windows, your app gains additional versatility, allowing people to use it alongside itself or multiple other applications. For example, someone using a to-do app could view two lists from that app side by side in Split View; they could also create multiple Split View instances that pair one of their to-do lists alongside a Safari window, while another to-do list sits next to Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/AFE9F429-FC4E-4FF9-8BA2-0CF3D1F723A4/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To add multiple windows to your app, you create scenes for each instance of your user interface using &lt;code&gt;UIScene&lt;/code&gt;. When you add support for &lt;code&gt;UIScene&lt;/code&gt;, consider also implementing modern state restoration, which lets people come right back to what they were working on in your app rather than resetting to the main screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you add multiple windows to iPad, that paves the way for multiple window support on Mac Catalyst if you’re also building a Mac app. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to make your app look great on every screen</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=nixcb564</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=nixcb564</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A2648508-E2DF-413D-BA2F-BE2F8D778AFD/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine, for a moment: You’ve just spotted the perfect pair of shoes online. They’re the right color, they’re designed impeccably, and you can’t wait to get them delivered and on your feet. Except, wait — they’re only made in size 7. And sadly, while you might be able to cram your feet in and wear them on occasion, they won’t be comfortable enough for daily use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, most shoe manufacturers don’t offer their shoes in just one size. Instead, when they create a new shoe model, they offer a range of sizes with the same design and functionality so that the customer can enjoy the one that fits best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the same for really great apps: When developing, you want to create an interface that adapts to a range of screen sizes with the same design and functionality for all. That way, whether someone uses iPhone SE or iPad Pro to view your app, they still get to have an enjoyable and comfortable experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, we’ve collected some of the best ways you can adapt your app’s interface so that it looks great, regardless of device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Universal design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you can design solely for specific platforms like iPhone, iPad, or Mac, consider creating a universal version of your app that supports multiple devices. This lets your customer choose how your app fits into their life, and it’s the most adaptive experience you can provide. Whether you’re creating apps designed for a single platform or multiple devices, however, they should support all available screen sizes and size classes for those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready to launch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great app experience starts with a universal launch screen: Designing the right one can make a world of difference in how quickly you can immerse people into your user interface. Use Xcode to create a launch screen storyboard — they’re flexible and support all device screen sizes, allowing you to use a single storyboard to manage your launch screens on every platform you support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=voseytot"&gt;Learn more about designing launch screens for seamless&amp;nbsp;starts&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/5E103D81-48D2-4711-8041-F9AAC6C56950/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get into Auto Layout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When crafting your interface, Auto Layout can help you adapt to any screen size. It provides guidelines for your app that relate the positioning of one piece of content to any other content or views. This lets your content scale and reflow in the manner you intend it. Avoid using absolute screen coordinates, as those may result in off-center buttons or awkward content flow on different screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilayoutguide"&gt;Learn more about Auto Layout in the Developer&amp;nbsp;Library&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore SwiftUI&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your app is built for iOS 13, iPadOS 13, watchOS 6, tvOS 13, or macOS Catalina, you may want to also consider implementing SwiftUI. The declarative nature of SwiftUI ensures that your content is adaptable out of the box, and that code is also often reusable when building apps for other Apple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master multitasking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re developing an app that supports iPad, remember that people can use it in a variety of ways: They can browse the app in full screen, put it next to another app in Split View, pull it up in Slide Over, or (if your app supports it) even view multiple windows side by side. Consider each of these size classes and how your interface can successfully adapt to provide the best experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/system-capabilities/multitasking/"&gt;Get started with&amp;nbsp;multitasking&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keep your content readable&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to design for a great reading experience on all devices if you have text- or image-heavy content in your app. Let the Readable Content Guide do the heavy lifting for you: The layout guide defines an area that can easily be read without extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622644-readablecontentguide"&gt;Learn more about the Readable Content&amp;nbsp;Guide&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/965793EB-9368-42C7-B147-5CE594943CDE/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, make sure your reading experience is accessible. Many people prefer to change their text size to something other than the default. Supporting Dynamic Type ensures your text scales to what your customer has indicated they want. It also ensures that as the text gets larger or smaller, other on-screen elements dynamically move to accommodate these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility/overview/text-size-and-weight/"&gt;Learn more about designing with text weight and size in mind &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, query for feature availability and provide conditional paths based on the results of that check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when building an AR app, you can use the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arconfiguration/2923553-issupported"&gt;&lt;code&gt;isSupported&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; property of the appropriate ARConfiguration subclass to see whether a device supports a given configuration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="code-source"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="syntax-class"&gt;&lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="syntax-title"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="syntax-title"&gt;isSupported&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="syntax-title"&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;{ &lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preview your work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Xcode 11, you can do a lot of your basic interface testing directly in Previews. This allows you to see how your interface handles different conditions, devices, and use cases. You can automatically see how Dynamic Type might render if your app is running on iPhone SE, for example, or view different localization options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Previews are designed to work with SwiftUI, you can also use them with your existing Swift or Obj-C views to make sure your UI remains adaptable as you change your code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/233/"&gt;Watch “Mastering Xcode&amp;nbsp;Previews”&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Meet the developer: Panic</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=t4n6e4wo</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=t4n6e4wo</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A41B17CE-7A90-4913-8397-6D55EBE69463/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;How Panic manages to find beauty in FTP and SSH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be cool to be a developer these days, but that wasn’t always the case—especially not in 1998, when Cabel Sasser and Steven Frank started Panic. Running a fledgling software company was daunting and exhausting, but the duo was having so much fun they didn’t care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Steven once compared our relationship to that of R2-D2 and C-3PO,” Sasser says. “I roll around making strange noises and interfacing with things, while he stays the course, flapping his arms and fretting about protocol. But they need each other to succeed, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4732A4C2-18A1-4E87-8374-E5C870360647/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Yes, even an FTP client can look great and be easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Panic started, developers had to worry about more than coding a great app; they also had to figure out how and where they were going to sell it. The internet wasn’t the e-commerce juggernaut it is now. Developers needed to hit the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost impossible to comprehend now, but back in the day, if you wanted to sell an app, you had to manufacture boxes, sign up with an expensive distributor, try to get your boxed app onto the shelves at the computer store, and pay extra for placement on the endcap,” Sasser says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Transmit&lt;/em&gt;, the elegant FTP app Panic debuted in 1998, the company established what’s become a core principle: “Take a complicated thing and make it easy, beautiful, and powerful,” Sasser says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging that file-transfer apps aren’t exactly the most exciting, Sasser says he’s well aware that a lot of customers would be satisfied if &lt;em&gt;Transmit&lt;/em&gt; simply did the bare minimum. An FTP app doesn’t have to wow you. Nor do Panic’s other apps, like &lt;em&gt;Prompt&lt;/em&gt;, an SSH client, or &lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt;, a file manager and text editor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Sasser expects more. He wants Panic’s apps to appeal to your design sensibility as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a complicated thing and make it easy, beautiful, and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Panic cofounder Cabel Sasser&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The matrix is really simple: Too much design and you can alienate power users. Not enough and you’ll intimidate new users,” Sasser says. Striking the right balance applies to functionality as well. “Balancing design and functionality is one of the most difficult parts of our job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After decades spent developing software for the Mac, Sasser and Frank have earned the respect of customers and other developers alike. Sasser chalks this up to Panic’s core tenets: honesty, personality, and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As humans, we always know when a company is selling us some PR flimflam. It never works,” he says. “So we are always absolutely honest and up-front.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on the App Store and Mac App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Meet the developer: Shelley Taylor</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=2zjvl2ig</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=2zjvl2ig</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4C4EE2EB-C305-49BA-88A7-A83242CC525F/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;RefAid supports migrants around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, a 3-year-old Syrian boy named Aylan Kurdi drowned in the Mediterranean Sea trying to reach Europe with his family. The image of his body washed up on a beach in Lebanon devastated American startup veteran Shelley Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These migrants are coming into Europe, they get here, and they don’t know how to find the basic things—the supermarket, shelter, the doctor,” says Taylor, CEO of Trellyz, which creates software for cities and nonprofits. “And I thought, they all have smartphones, maybe I can create something that will let them find what they need when they need it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a weekend she built &lt;em&gt;RefAid—Refugee Aid App&lt;/em&gt; and launched it in the UK and Italy in February 2016. The app catalogs aid organizations’ services for migrants and refugees seeking to build a new life in Europe and, increasingly, the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/E5B75513-D37A-407A-B1F1-64DAFC1BE1DB/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The app reduces its language barrier with icons in addition to words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, the app is evolving from one designed to meet the basic daily survival needs of refugees to one able to tackle the many challenges of the mounting migrant crisis at the U.S. border and provide information during COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services have been added to address family separation, offering constantly updated intel about legal aid as well as geo-targeted push notifications with crucial on-the-ground information. For example, RefAid might send an alert with a phone number for free legal help in an area where migrants are being rounded up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app (which is now available in 25 countries, with some 5,000 aid organizations contributing) will soon include services in most U.S. states. Taylor and her team are constantly reaching out to more nonprofits and public service providers to include them in the app. Through a web-based content management system, they can manage and update their offerings and communicate directly with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These migrants are coming into Europe, they get here, and they don’t know how to find the basic things—the supermarket, shelter, the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available in English, Arabic, Farsi, Spanish, and soon French, the app directs refugees (using geolocation) to aid within a 100-mile radius. The services are sorted by categories like legal, food, education, work, media, faith groups, psychological, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solving one problem at a time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before launching RefAid, Taylor—who was raised in Palo Alto, California, but lives in Europe—needed to contact aid organizations and have them provide a list of services that could help migrants in need. She started with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the British Red Cross but quickly ran into a roadblock: Most of them didn’t readily know all of the services they provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B6D0C616-C873-4B47-BDFE-64787D5A544E/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The worldwide refugee crisis broke Shelley Taylor’s heart—so she made an app to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor waited weeks for aid groups to get back to her. “We called them and said, ‘Did you change your mind? Where are your services? We just need a little spreadsheet.’” And they said, uniformly, ‘Oh, we have to call each of the offices to ask them because nothing is written down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Taylor created what may be the first global database of nonprofit services. She doesn’t charge the organizations to use the app, covering the development and operating costs herself. “We didn’t want anyone to have an excuse to say no to putting their services on the app, because it’s such a huge problem and people really need help.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Help finding help&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although RefAid doesn’t have the capacity to respond to real-time updates from refugees and migrants, Taylor has anticipated the needs of people arriving by either land or sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you come into Greece, for example, the organizations don’t have the right to go to the beach directly. They have to stay in their offices — that’s the law. But, if somebody has told migrants to look at the app, those migrants can discover that around the corner there’s a Red Cross office and food vouchers, which they couldn’t have found otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/15FB0C62-FB8E-431C-9185-3E0B41A979BB/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Taylor in the French town of Calais, home to the notorious Calais Jungle refugee encampment where some 10,000 refugees sought shelter from 2015 to 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app is used primarily in the U.S., the UK, Belgium, France, Italy, and Greece. After the first attempted U.S. travel ban in January 2017, RefAid quickly deployed in 19 American cities, cataloging legal services nearby for those trapped at U.S. airports. In May 2018, 40 other cities—including Oslo, Athens, and Amsterdam—began listing their services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the current U.S. migrant crisis, new services from different aid organizations are being added daily. Some large resettlement organizations in the U.S., such as the International Refugee Committee, have actually started preloading cell phones with the RefAid app and giving them to migrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s exciting to see how it’s growing,” Taylor says, “but we still haven’t mapped the whole world. And that’s our goal: to map all of the services available to refugees and everyone else in the whole world. It’s just a step at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to support per-app language settings in your app</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=u2cfuj88</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=u2cfuj88</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/2C304568-8FDD-4BF9-9CDD-6F2C086010DE/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you localize your app, people all over the world can view your content in the language they feel most comfortable reading. And with the latest versions of iOS and macOS, people can have even more control by choosing languages on a per-app basis. For example, someone may set their iPhone’s language to English, but want to use a social media app in Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good news: If your project is built with iOS 13 or macOS Catalina and localized into more than one language, you won’t have to add any additional code to your app. Simply build and deploy your app to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how someone might check per-app language switching for a specific app, using AllTrails as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open&lt;/strong&gt; the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to &lt;strong&gt;AllTrails &amp;gt; Preferred Language &amp;gt; Language&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the preferred language to &lt;strong&gt;Spanish&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch &lt;strong&gt;AllTrails&lt;/strong&gt; from your home screen (or from the App Switcher, if the app is already open).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/488F508F-597F-41E3-AC19-D498DFBB2DC0/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Once someone has set their preferred languages for an app in Settings, it will then render accordingly in your app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;AllTrails will now render in Spanish, while the rest of the device continues to display the system language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Restore your state after a change in the language setting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone decides mid-activity that they’d like to view your app in a different language, you can make the experience even smoother for them by restoring their previous state when they return. For example, say you’re living abroad and looking for food using a restaurant delivery app. By default, you use English, but might want to switch the app’s language when viewing a certain restaurant’s menu so that you can better understand its native dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that app supports state restoration, you can exit to the Settings app and return to the restaurant you were viewing — now in the new language. If not, you’ll have to start from the app’s main screen and find that restaurant again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your app supports scene-based state restoration, you can implement &lt;code&gt;stateRestorationActivity(for scene)&lt;/code&gt; and return an &lt;code&gt;NSUserActivity&lt;/code&gt; that encodes the scene state. (And if you still support view controller state restoration, you can enable state restoration on your app delegate.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/news/?id=4ixc0yxs"&gt;Learn more about implementing state restoration &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to load custom content in the correct language&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need to load content from other sources, such as a server, you can do so and ensure that you match the app’s language with a few bundle APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bundle.main.preferredLocalizations.first&lt;/code&gt; will get the system’s current language in priority order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to check against a custom set of available languages (say, from a server or other source), you can do so with a simple modification to the previous API call. First, find out what available languages there are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="code-source"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; availableLanguages = &lt;span class="syntax-type"&gt;Server&lt;/span&gt;.requestAvailableLanguages()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, use the &lt;code&gt;preferredLocalization&lt;/code&gt; API with those languages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="code-source"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="syntax-type"&gt;Bundle&lt;/span&gt;.preferredLocalizations(from: availableLanguages).first.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it’s not possible to have ongoing communication with the server due to connectivity or other constraints, you can also send the output of &lt;code&gt;Bundle.main.preferredLocalizations.first&lt;/code&gt; to the server; that way, it will know which language the app has been launched in and deliver content accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to transition away from a custom language selector in your app&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With systemwide support for in-app language selectors, you no longer need to provide a way to select languages within your app if you support iOS 13 or macOS Catalina or later. If you currently offer such a UI, you should remove it to avoid customer confusion and potential conflict with the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to guide people to the system settings for language selection, you can replace your app’s custom UI with a flow that launches directly into the Settings app on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On iOS, add the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="code-source"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="syntax-type"&gt;UIApplication&lt;/span&gt;.shared.&lt;span class="syntax-keyword"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="syntax-type"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;(string: &lt;span class="syntax-type"&gt;UIApplication&lt;/span&gt;.openSettingsURLString)!)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;On macOS, direct people to &lt;strong&gt;System Preferences &amp;gt; Language &amp;amp; Region&lt;/strong&gt; to add a per-language setting for your app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/403"&gt;Watch “Creating Great Localized Experiences with Xcode 11” &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ready your app for a localized launch</title>

<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/119F5757-7157-4DEE-9909-49393C65B45A/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve localized your app, it’s time to get ready for an international and localized launch. Here’s how you can localize your App Store product page, set international pricing, and adapt your marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Localize your product page&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Localize your App Store metadata, such as your app description, keywords, and screenshots, for each of the countries or territories in which you offer your app. You can also translate your app’s name and tailor your keywords to reflect the values of each market so your app might better resonate with the local audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/deve6f78a8e2"&gt;Learn more about localizing your App Store information &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Users pay for your apps and in-app purchases with credit or debit cards, carrier billing, digital wallets, or App Store and iTunes gift cards, depending on regional availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pricing your apps and in-app purchases, you’ll choose a price tier in App Store Connect that contains prices already adjusted appropriately for the market in each country or region. For auto-renewable subscriptions, you can choose from 200 price points across all available currencies and price tiers to offer appropriate pricing for each location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev0d56b50d9"&gt;Learn more about setting in-app purchase pricing &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Research which social networks or other channels are most popular with local audiences, as these may vary significantly across markets, and use them to spread the word about your app. Localize any materials you use in your marketing and user acquisition efforts, such as screenshots, banners, and advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/AD8A2BF7-87C6-4222-806D-A942CC1AFD4F/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Store Badges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the Download on the App Store badge in your communications as a clear call to action to download your app. Localized badges are available to let your international audience know that your app is tailored for them. Download badges from the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/?cid=developer80"&gt;App Store Marketing Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Ads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, you can drive discovery of your app with Apple Search Ads, which lets you promote your app at the top of relevant App Store search results in more than 59 countries and regions.

<title>How to localize your app</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=jzqnn1av</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=jzqnn1av</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/ECC72997-C6C5-47AD-89AE-0DF1FE6C7DBE/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you deliver great localization in your app, you can support your customers in their native language and provide a better overall experience. Here’s how you can get started localizing your content quickly and effectively inside Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Translate your app’s content&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing_your_app"&gt;Xcode Export For Localization&lt;/a&gt; feature to automatically extract all localizable content, including strings referenced from code, stringsdict files, and Interface Builder files, as well as any localized assets. This process shouldn’t require modifications to your source code, making it easy to work on translations in-house or with an external localization service. Be sure to also localize &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/protecting_the_user_s_privacy/requesting_access_to_protected_resources"&gt;purpose strings&lt;/a&gt; for a consistent app experience, and consider localizing your privacy policy so that all users have a clear understanding of how their data may be handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Services&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Apple APIs to automatically present localized buttons, payment sheets, errors, and more for &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/implementation/"&gt;Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/wallet"&gt;Apple Wallet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple"&gt;Sign in with Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audiovisual Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also provide localized support for audiovisual media in your app using AVKit and AVFoundation. These &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/media_assets_playback_and_editing/adding_subtitles_and_alternative_audio_tracks"&gt;frameworks&lt;/a&gt; provide built-in support for easily presenting subtitles and closed captions, and for selecting alternative audio and video tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Localization Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If choosing an external localization service to help translate content, find out if they specialize in localizing for particular languages, cultures, or categories, and confirm the levels of quality assurance they provide. Providing the service with context about your app and content can help increase efficiency and minimize translation errors. Consider creating a guide with important details — for example, a playbook with character names and personalities, explanations of jokes or humor, a glossary of frequently used terms, and screenshots that show where the translations will be used. Avoid machine translation as your only translation method, since this can lead to inaccurate and low-quality translation because it does not account for context, cultural sensitivities or language nuances. For example, the “book” button in a hotel app might be incorrectly translated to be “novel” rather than “reserve”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing_your_app"&gt;Learn more about localizing your app in Xcode &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Test your localization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configure test plans in Xcode to easily run tests with different settings and define your testing variants in one place. This helps flag any instances of clipping, truncation, layout overlapping, or issues with right-to-left formatting for the devices and languages you support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/31DA8033-13AE-4DDC-BAB5-A41C64DE227D/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use the Localization Screenshots feature to generate localized screenshots from successful tests and export these screenshots for use in tutorials, marketing materials, or your App Store product page. Once your app is localized, use &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/testflight/?cid=developer80"&gt;TestFlight&lt;/a&gt; to share your app with a group of users in the market to get feedback and gather opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/413/"&gt;Watch “Testing in Xcode” &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to prepare your app for a global audience</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vdo2w6y4</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vdo2w6y4</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/483985DB-0734-442E-987E-8C5009F0EA5D/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The App Store is available in 175 countries and regions and 40 languages to make it easy for people around the world to discover and download your app. This week, we’re showing you how localizing your app can help make it more relevant to local cultures and languages and help you grow your business — and that starts with preparing your app for a global audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Structure your app for localization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internationalization, the process of structuring your app’s code and UI for localization, is a fundamental first step in building apps for a global audience. With Apple’s powerful tools and technologies, including Xcode 11, Apple APIs, Auto Layout, and Unicode support, it’s easy to prepare your apps to support multiple languages and regions, even before you know which languages you’d like to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Xcode, make sure your user-visible text and images are separate from your executable code. When you translate these elements into other languages, you can integrate the content back into your app as separate localized resource files stored within the app bundle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images — including image sets, Apple Watch complications, Apple TV image stacks, Sprite Atlases, and symbol sets — can be localized directly in your Asset Catalog. You can also use localized &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/"&gt;SF system symbols&lt;/a&gt; and set the directionality for custom symbols — for example, for right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/43D041DE-3FAB-4C0E-BCE7-D21E5C8E03DF/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use Apple APIs to correctly express user-visible or dynamically-generated values, such as dates, lengths, weights, prices, and currency symbols, across different locales. Ensure your app accepts user-generated text in any language and in multiple languages at once, independent of the user interface language. This allows app content to appear in someone’s preferred language and format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also take advantage of Auto Layout to automatically adjust the dimensions and layouts of views, extensive Unicode support to work with text from any language, the powerful text handling technologies of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch to display, lay out, and edit text in many languages, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/403/"&gt;Watch “Create great localized experiences with Xcode 11” &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing_your_app"&gt;Learn more about localizing your app in Xcode &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Investigate market factors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market-specific demographics, such as population, language, and purchasing power, can help you better understand areas that might have an affinity or need for your app. Every market has its own preferences for the types of apps or categories customers most enjoy. For example, games are popular worldwide, however strategy games may be more popular in a particular region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider selecting markets with similar attributes to those in which you have already established success, such as strong app downloads, sales, usage, or retention metrics, as this may make for easier growth. When selecting a market, assess how your app might fit in and how its value and functionality aligns with that market’s needs. You may even identify a need in the market that is not yet filled, allowing you to bring unique value to people with your app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Use App Analytics to determine potential markets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you offer your app worldwide but haven’t localized for particular regions, you can look at key performance metrics, such as Product Page Views, App Units, Sales, and Active Devices, filtered by territory. This can help you determine if your app is attracting people in a particular territory that might benefit from localization. For example, if your app is primarily in English and you see lower than average retention or Sessions per Active Device in Germany, you might consider adding German language support. Keep in mind that some markets may have greater proficiency with your app’s primary language, while others may require more significant localization work. Usage data such as active devices, sessions, and retention include only users who have agreed to share their diagnostics and usage information with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/analytics/?cid=developer80"&gt;Learn more about gaining insights with App Analytics &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Consider local culture and customs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While your app and product page should each provide a consistent experience across all markets, it’s sometimes valuable to refine certain elements for cultural relevance. For example, you might try incorporating market-specific content or cultural moments, such as special holiday content or regional art styles. You may want to consider any local policies and market regulations, as well as any political or religious sensitivities, to increase the likelihood that your app is well received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/localization/?cid=developer80"&gt;Learn more about expanding your app to new markets &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Meet the developer: Philip Lam</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=wk9cj822</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=wk9cj822</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B6FFF57A-FA47-47FB-AE68-BFF6C95533CD/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The A.I.-powered app has revolutionized basketball practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;HomeCourt is quite possibly the biggest thing to happen to basketball practice since the invention of the sneaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app uses artificial intelligence (A.I.) and augmented reality (AR) to create and shape on-court basketball drills. It can tell whether you’re shooting off the dribble, catching and shooting, or just practicing free throws. It will measure your release time and the angle of your shot. It knows how fast you’re moving before you shoot. It calculates your vertical leap. And after your workout, you can see performance charts and a video breakdown right away. It’s a metrics fan’s dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/AF949544-D50C-47A4-BF7D-AD03F5A4CFDE/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;HomeCourt lets you watch your dribbling skills in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;HomeCourt offers real-time coaching as well. With the help of your iPhone or iPad’s front-facing camera, you can get real-time feedback from coaches across town or on the other side of the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people shelter in place around the world, HomeCourt has made its services free to everyone through May 31. A recent feature update also lets coaches create a virtual team roster in the app, so players, coaches, and parents can participate in remote workouts, drills, and competitions. The company is also working on other ways it can support basketball players and coaches while school activities, practices, and tournaments are being cancelled or postponed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cofounder Philip Lam says the company’s shot-tracking prototype kicked everything off. “Even though it could only track shots in a few specific situations,” he says, “it made us believe it was possible to use a single smartphone camera to track complex basketball activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/03454FE9-B553-45AC-892A-BAA37B6A761D/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Get instant feedback right on the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the company has 22 employees in Hong Kong and San Jose, California, and players across the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Lam explains how HomeCourt got into the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”Before we launched, we played pickup basketball every week, and we started talking about how great it would be if we could get our stats — who hit the most shots, who got the most rebounds, all that stuff. And the idea just came up: Can we actually use the camera on the phone to do that for us? That’s how it started.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We built HomeCourt on mobile to make it affordable to players around the world. We came up with the idea of simulating the Stephen Curry tennis-ball drill with an interactive AR experience. That turned out to be the foundation of HomeCourt’s dribble workout. Everyone on the team was really excited to try it and compete with each other.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C8E799E1-3C62-445E-8D1F-5A80D845C5ED/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Yes, the app keeps track of this many stats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”Most other basketball training applications are content-based — no other mobile solution provides this system of proven training techniques combined with real-time A.I.-powered analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In mid-2018, we built a prototype that could track advanced metrics, like release angle, release time, and vertical jump. We named this feature Shot Science. At that time, the iPhone X was the latest iOS device. It was powerful, but it still wasn’t fast enough to run Shot Science in real time and enable players to hear audio shot analysis during a live practice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPhone series came in September 2018, and it was a much more powerful device for running machine-learning algorithms. We found our algorithm [ran] six times faster in the iPhone series with the A12 Bionic chip. With the optimization in our algorithm, we could finally offer Real-Time Shot Science. The opportunity to demonstrate that at the 2018 Apple iPhone event [was] definitely one of the most special days in our journey so far.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/6C4080D2-3099-4CD2-9139-6BFC62AA830D/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;A sketch of the design that eventually became HomeCourt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”We’ve had parents tell us that it becomes a competition with videogames: “Oh, they really do practice more, and they play fewer videogames, and I’m really happy about it!” And I’m really happy about it too!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And, yes, we still definitely play every week.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Design launch screens for seamless starts</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=voseytot</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=voseytot</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4BA466BD-84A5-48AB-BB84-F97AB8164464/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instantaneous app launches are a big part of providing a great experience on iPhone or iPad. Whether someone is tapping on your app icon for the first time or returning from elsewhere, they should be able to get started immediately. A launch screen lets you provide that seamless and adaptive experience while your app loads any pertinent information in the background, and you can create it directly in Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing the right storyboard for your launch screen can make a world of difference in how quickly you can immerse people into your user interface. Here are a few recommendations and tips to help you create great launch screens for your app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support all device screen sizes by creating launch screen storyboards in Xcode&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although people won’t be able to interact with your launch screen, you should always build your screen using an Xcode storyboard. Storyboards are flexible and adaptable and support all device screen sizes, which allows you to use a single storyboard to manage your launch screens for every platform you support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Don't use a static image for your launch screen. Static images have been deprecated and all App Store apps must use an Xcode storyboard to provide an app’s launch screen by June 30, 2020. Learn more &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03262020b"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mirror your main screen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fastest way to convince someone your app is responsive and ready to go is to show them the same interface in your launch screen that they expect on your app’s main screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an app first starts up, it shows its launch screen before transitioning to the main interface. When someone switches away, the app automatically saves an App Snapshot of its interface so that it can return to where they left off; if an app can’t restore its state in this way, however, it will display the launch screen instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, you want to make sure your launch screen storyboard looks close to identical to your main interface. If you include elements that look dramatically different, it may be confusing or jarring when your app shifts to the main screen. If you have an app that might take a bit longer to load, like a game, and you’d like to provide any kind of animated experience during that time, we recommend using a solid color background; from there, the app can move gracefully to the game’s first screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/13281207-EE0F-4F4E-9216-E52E4C92AB2D/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Consider the light and the dark&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone launches your app, you want them to feel immersed — no matter their appearance settings. We’ve already addressed how to create adaptive launch screen storyboards, but it’s also important to think about a device’s appearance. If your app supports Dark Mode, your launch screen storyboard should as well. Make sure that your storyboard uses adaptive colors, and set the background of the view to the System Background Color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Assess your assets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything you add to your launch screen storyboard should be optimized appropriately. If you want to add an asset to your storyboard, such as a static image that normally appears as part of your app’s user interface, make sure that its image dimensions are no larger than the view it's going to be placed in. Your storyboard may not display if you use assets at larger resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Launch with a global audience in mind&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike your app’s interface, your app’s launch screen can’t be localized into other languages: Any text you display in your storyboard will remain in the original language you select. As such, it's best to avoid including any text at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/423/"&gt;Watch “Optimizing app launch”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C093FF5F-7F32-4ABF-8BB5-B0C2AF6A1703/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People naturally multitask on their devices. Whether they’re switching from app to app, bringing together apps on iPad using Slide Over or Split View, or creating multiple windows of the same app, they should be able to pick up right where they left off — and UI state restoration is a core part of making that experience seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your app goes out of view, the app’s process is typically put on pause; it’s not given any more CPU time, which keeps the processor free for other tasks. If your app has background processes that are running, the system can even terminate those if an active app needs more resources than currently available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restoring the state of your UI is a crucial part of making your app feel responsive — and it’s especially important if you plan to support multiple windows in your iPadOS app. If you have a note-taking app that has four different notes open in different Split View pairings, for example, state restoration helps preserve each note, rather than returning someone to the main screen when they open one of the windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/AD4008A5-831B-4D78-9AA9-1D8059D4BB33/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Two different types of scenes can be backgrounded and processes halted. These scenes’ states should be saved to restore later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meet NSUserActivity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSUserActivity&lt;/code&gt; is a core part of modern state restoration with &lt;code&gt;UIScene&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UISceneDelegate&lt;/code&gt;: It provides a lightweight way to capture the state of your app and put it to use later, holding key information for both view controllers and important view states — information that can also be used when constructing view controllers for &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/task_management/implementing_handoff_in_your_app"&gt;Handoff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/inter-process_communication/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content"&gt;Universal Linking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While what you store in &lt;code&gt;NSUserActivity&lt;/code&gt; is up to you, we recommend collecting only the bare minimum so that your app can quickly restore itself. Think of the most unique and simple way you can identify your view controller, like a clear identifier or URL. Include that information, and make sure you can identify where the view controller lives in your navigation and how content should appear within it. For example, when using an Xcode storyboard you may want to store and retrieve view controllers using restoration IDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get started with UI state restoration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to implement UI state restoration is to make your app scene-based, which requires iOS 13, iPadOS 13, Mac Catalyst 10.13, or tvOS 13 or later. (For more information on working with scenes in your app, check out the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes"&gt;Developer Library&lt;/a&gt;.) Here’s how to get started with scene-based state restoration: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;NSUserActivity&lt;/code&gt; object to save the app's state. This can be created in your scene delegate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this &lt;code&gt;NSUserActivity&lt;/code&gt;, store relevant information (like the current navigation’s state, and view controllers that have been presented or pushed) along with your user’s intent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return this &lt;code&gt;NSUserActivity&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;stateRestorationActivity(for:)&lt;/code&gt; in the scene delegate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C4E81D37-61B8-4384-ADF9-B825B1AA59E2/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;You need to collect the right information in each UIScene to pick up where someone left off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;NSUserActivity&lt;/code&gt; will now be stored inside the scene’s &lt;code&gt;stateRestorationActivity&lt;/code&gt; property. When your app needs to restore its state, it should do so by looking for this saved &lt;code&gt;NSUserActivity&lt;/code&gt; under &lt;code&gt;scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)&lt;/code&gt; in the scene delegate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the older view controller-based state restoration APIs?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to support older versions of iOS, macOS, or tvOS, you can use older view controller-based APIs for state restoration via restoration classes and the app delegate. This also means if you want to update your app to adopt UIScene as well as implement UI state restoration across multiple versions of iOS, you will need to implement both scene-based and view-controller based APIs. However, we highly recommend building scene-based UI state restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the older APIs, modern state restoration requires a different approach to how you define, save, and restore your UI state and your user’s intent. With a scene-based app, you have to separate events in an application’s life cycle and the scene’s life cycle, which means tracking changes also differs. Having multiple scenes means there are many more windows to track, each with unique user actions and navigation history. For some of those windows, you may choose not to restore state depending on their function, requiring state restoration to be more flexible and dependent on how you define the user’s intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4AA05114-11D2-4E36-B59C-EC89461A6763/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Prior to the introduction of UIScene, each app had a singular life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can update your app to scene-based restoration and take advantage of &lt;code&gt;NSUserActivity&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll also unlock easier pathways to implementing features like Spotlight search, Handoff, enabling Universal Links, and creating new scenes as primary or auxiliary windows. And you’ll provide a smoother and frictionless experience for people using your app, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/258/"&gt;Watch “Architecting your app for multiple windows”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Meet the developer: Brian Mueller</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8xd0lp1u</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8xd0lp1u</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/1D0AA298-AF55-4EFB-B16D-D81E457543C5/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Brian Mueller can make anything hilarious. Even the weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Mueller is something of a Renaissance man. He single-handedly codes, designs, illustrates, and writes all of the dialogue for his wisecracking Carrot apps, which fall into categories that typically don’t have a lot of personality: to-do lists, alarm clocks, calorie counters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To call his style droll would be an understatement. The exercise app &lt;em&gt;Carrot Fit&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, implores you to “jump flabby human, jump for freedom!” in a deadpan robotic voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more about Brian Mueller and his approach, check out &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/grailr/?cid=developer80"&gt;this video interview&lt;/a&gt; where he details Carrot Weather’s evolution on Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/FA00E49D-477F-4EE9-A8AF-990F6F53AC9A/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Each Carrot app delivers surprising punch lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrot To-Do&lt;/em&gt; is equally sardonic — “It’s been 18 hours since you did anything useful” — while &lt;em&gt;Carrot Weather&lt;/em&gt; takes liberties with its forecasts. “It’s a beautiful day! Ha ha, just kidding. It’s raining.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smack-talking to-do list app might not seem like the big idea that would let you quit your day job. In fact, Carrot’s success caught even Mueller off guard. “For some reason, people have responded to this. I still can’t believe sometimes any of this caught on,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working out of a spare room in his Philadelphia-area home, the former aspiring screenwriter has penned thousands of lines of dialogue for his apps, which he constantly updates to nod to current events. (A recent one-liner from &lt;em&gt;Carrot Weather&lt;/em&gt;: “Don’t tell anyone, but I regularly send bad weather to areas with high concentrations of stay-at-home order protesters.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/0B9918C1-55F0-4D10-BE54-0A86F0F2B7A9/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Mueller is a one-man team, making half a dozen apps from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the inspiration for &lt;em&gt;Carrot&lt;/em&gt;, Mueller credits those closest to him: his mom, sister, and wife — all of whom tease one another relentlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of the dialogue for &lt;em&gt;Carrot&lt;/em&gt; is drawn out of stuff that we’ve actually said to each other,” he says. “Every time my wife says something funny, I write it down for the apps. Sometimes she gets annoyed by that, but she’s a lot funnier than I am.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/39ABBAA6-B324-42F0-895B-C8901CC12DE8/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Brian Mueller’s wife, Greta, is one of Carrot’s biggest inspirations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mueller dreamed up the idea to create a character-driven app, he had zero coding experience. “I’m an English major with a creative-writing minor. I love to write and create characters and tell stories, but I had no real idea of what I would do with my life.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mueller’s first instinct was to hire a developer to realize his vision. “I didn’t want to sound like a jerk when talking to a programmer, so I bought a book on iOS programming for beginners, just to know what terms to use,” he says. As he read &lt;em&gt;iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide&lt;/em&gt;, Mueller was surprised by how easy it is to make an app. By January 2013, &lt;em&gt;Carrot To-Do&lt;/em&gt; had launched on the App Store. It took him about a month to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love to write and create characters and tell stories, but I had no real idea of what I would do with my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Brian Mueller, Carrot creator&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, sales were tepid. It took a couple of years, and a few more apps, before &lt;em&gt;Carrot&lt;/em&gt; found a broad-enough audience for Mueller to quit his day job and become a full-time developer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Carrot&lt;/em&gt; universe continues to expand. Mueller has built seven iOS apps and an iOS sticker pack, as well as Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Mac versions of &lt;em&gt;Carrot Weather&lt;/em&gt;. With the arrival of AR (augmented reality) technologies on iOS, Mueller taught himself how to add an AR component to &lt;em&gt;Carrot Weather&lt;/em&gt;. Now you can see the surly character Carrot as a spherical “ocular sensor” hovering in your surroundings. She turns red if you annoy her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/E642736A-A29B-4CAB-9EBC-0369D7EF4675/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Watch Carrot float around your world in Carrot Weather’s AR mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although being a one-man app shop isn’t easy, Mueller enjoys wearing all the hats. “When I hit a road block with coding, I can take a break and switch to writing or doing some design work,” he says. “I’m not stuck doing the same thing over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's a weird way to work, but I'm a bit of a perfectionist and it allows me to make exactly what I want.”&lt;/p&gt;

<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=04142020a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When taxes or foreign exchange rates change, we sometimes need to update prices on the App Store. In the next few days, prices of apps on the App Store and in-app purchases (excluding auto-renewable subscriptions) will change in Barbados, Moldova, and Uzbekistan due to new value-added taxes. Your proceeds will be adjusted accordingly and will be calculated based on the tax-exclusive price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low value-added tax was also introduced in Malaysia. Prices on the App Store in Malaysia will not change and proceeds will be adjusted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can download the updated price tier charts now. Once these changes go into effect, the Pricing and Availability section of My Apps will be updated. You can change the price of your apps and in-app purchases (including auto-renewable subscriptions) at any time in App Store Connect. If you offer subscriptions, you can choose to preserve prices for existing subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunespartner.apple.com/assets/downloads/0420-Apps-Pricing.pdf"&gt;View updated &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;price tiers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Meet the developer: Catana Chetwynd</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ab1gdyed</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ab1gdyed</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A5E69232-C8E3-425D-87B1-691876D6B960/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;For fans of Catana Comics, her sticker app was love at first sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving with her boyfriend’s parents, a bout of the flu, and a “very old” iPad. These were the circumstances that gave rise to Catana Chetwynd’s beloved cartoons back in 2016, when she was 21 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had been playing around with drawing on the iPad for a few months and John [now her fiancé] suggested that I make a comic,” she says. “It seemed like a good way to pass the time, since I wasn’t feeling well. Turns out, it was really fun!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, she drew five more comics based on everyday situations in her relationship, like not-so-subtly requesting back rubs from John and rolling her eyes at his juvenile jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F83A3965-F100-4223-9B0E-666B8F976C97/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;John and Catana: the real-life couple behind the cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;John, a software engineer, posted them on Reddit, and the internet fell hard: more than 2,000 comments poured in.  “We were really surprised by the flood of positive responses,” Chetwynd says. John set up a website and she created an Instagram account—which now has nearly 3 million followers—and Catana Comics was born.  “There are some incredibly awesome webcomics out there,” Chetwynd says, “but when we started, there weren’t really any based on a couple.” She has found that most of her fans enjoy sharing her comics with a significant other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A82AEA90-53EC-4497-940D-43836A6526E7/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;How Catana Comics go from sketch to screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes sense, then, that the number-one request Chetwynd got from her followers was for a sticker pack. With the Catana Comics iMessage app, fans can easily exchange her big-eyed, huge-hearted caricatures with a special someone.  “Shortly after we came out with the first batch of stickers,” Chetwynd says, “I received an email from a woman who said that her husband was on a very long business trip in a different time zone. She loved that the stickers allowed them to quickly send emotive messages without using words.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/19A625F0-EAEA-4FB4-916C-F5E2F68651A7/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Fans demanded stickers—and here they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chetwynd can relate, since she and John connect via her stickers too: “We both work from home, but in different rooms, and there are so many days where the only communication we’ll have is sending each other a sticker every hour or so.”  One of her go-tos: a drawing of John looking at a picture of her saying, “I miss you.”  “It was in the very first release and I wasn’t thinking it could be funny when I made it, but now John will go to the bathroom and I’ll send it to him,” she says. “I use it almost every day.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to support Route Guidance in CarPlay Dashboard</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=tsmnvknj</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=tsmnvknj</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C75DE8B0-854D-4582-9506-EF587989D1A5/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;CarPlay Dashboard consolidates music, maps, and Siri suggestions into a single screen inside your car for a safer, smarter experience. Starting with iOS 13.4, you can add support for CarPlay Dashboard in your navigation app, too: Make your map, upcoming maneuvers, and dashboard buttons available at a glance by adopting a few new capabilities inside the CarPlay framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: To integrate your app with CarPlay Dashboard, your CarPlay navigation app needs to support &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes"&gt;UIScene&lt;/a&gt;. For more information on adopting UIScene, check out &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/212/"&gt;“Introducing Multiple Windows on iPad”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get started with CarPlay Dashboard&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support CarPlay Dashboard inside your navigation app, you’ll need to update to &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/"&gt;Xcode 11.4&lt;/a&gt; if you haven’t already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iOS 13.4 offers new capabilities within the CarPlay framework: &lt;code&gt;CPDashboardButton&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CPDashboardController&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;CPTemplateApplicationDashboardScene&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPTemplateApplicationDashboardScene is a new UIScene subclass that CarPlay creates when it determines that your app should appear in CarPlay Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPDashboardController and CPDashboardButton let you manage controls that appear in CarPlay Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to add support for CarPlay Dashboard&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of CarPlay Dashboard, start by supporting CPTemplateApplicationDashboardScene and its related protocol CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: You need use CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate instead of CPApplicationDelegate to support this feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll take you through each step below. In addition, we’ve provided a sample application scene manifest for your reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="code-source"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="syntax-tag"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class="syntax-name"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;UIApplicationSceneManifest&lt;span class="syntax-tag"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class="syntax-name"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="syntax-tag"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class="syntax-name"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;MyAppCarPlayDashboardSceneDelegate&lt;span class="syntax-tag"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class="syntax-name"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="syntax-tag"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class="syntax-name"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="syntax-tag"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class="syntax-name"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="syntax-tag"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class="syntax-name"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="syntax-tag"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class="syntax-name"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Create a scene delegate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, define a scene delegate for CPTemplateApplicationSceneSessionRoleApplication. This can be done dynamically in your UIApplicationDelegate by returning a configuration in application:configurationForConnectingSceneSession:options:, or ahead of time in your app's Info.plist in the Application Scene Manifest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delegate must conform to CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate, where it will be given an instance of CPInterfaceController and CPWindow, as you've been used to with CPApplicationDelegate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, to support CPTemplateApplicationDashboardScene, include a new key in your Application Scene Manifest to declare support for CarPlay Dashboard: CPSupportsDashboardNavigationScene with a value of true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Define the dashboard delegate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next define your delegate to the dashboard scene just like you would for the main template application scene. This delegate conforms to CPTemplateApplicationDashboardSceneDelegate and will be given an instance of CPDashboardController and UIWindow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Draw your CarPlay Dashboard content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the provided window to draw navigation related content for display in the CarPlay Dashboard, similar to the CPWindow given to the main template application scene. You can also provide two instances of CPDashboardButton to CPDashboardController that appear in the guidance card widget while your app is not actively navigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Use your app in CarPlay Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can interact with your app through both the dashboard buttons as well as within your main app interface. When navigation begins in your app using CPMapTemplate and CPNavigationSession, CarPlay will automatically display maneuvers in the guidance widget. When navigation ends, it will revert to your currently set dashboard buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/carplay"&gt;Learn more about creating apps &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;for CarPlay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to scan and analyze surroundings with the LiDAR Scanner on iPad Pro</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=qwhaoe0x</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=qwhaoe0x</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/19D84ED0-2828-48F0-A76F-8338C27049EF/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARKit 3.5 can take advantage of the LiDAR Scanner on the iPad Pro 11-inch (2nd generation) and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (4th generation) to help your apps better understand physical environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how your apps can use information from the cameras and LiDAR Scanner to analyze the real world, get depth information, and form 3D meshes that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accurately locate points on physical surfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize and classify physical objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occlude virtual objects with real-world objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable realistic interactions between virtual and physical objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, An AR game might use mesh generated by Scene Geometry, which uses information from the LiDAR Scanner, to let someone realistically bounce a virtual ball off a physical wall inside their room.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Meet the developer: Rich Siegel</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=r2xowjrr</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=r2xowjrr</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/E914381A-67BB-4236-8645-48483C67B47A/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Why BBEdit creator Rich Siegel has always put the user above all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBEdit may be one of the most beloved developer tools on any platform, but its creator, Rich Siegel, had relatively modest ambitions. He started writing the first version of the software back in 1989 because he needed an editor that could handle “large” files—something north of 32 KB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the limitations of Macintosh Pascal was that source files couldn’t be more than 32 kilobytes,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a quarter century has passed since BBEdit’s commercial debut, and the app has become a favorite among developers, scientists, web designers, and writers alike for its sheer power and speed. (Siegel regularly tests 12 GB files these days.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siegel remains BBEdit’s principal architect and lead engineer, and the caffeine molecule tattooed on his arm says a lot about his work ethic. We spoke with him from his Bare Bones Software headquarters north of Boston, which Siegel shares with a pair of African gray parrots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/AC00999C-26CF-4096-9325-2F058066B538/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/promote/"&gt;Developers, do you have an interesting story to tell? The App Store‘s editorial team would love to hear it!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the early days of BBEdit like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, the way to put Mac software out in the world was to submit it to the Info-Mac Archive, an FTP repository hosted by Stanford. So that’s what I did, and word started to spread pretty fast online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had mentioned that if anyone wanted a copy on disk, they could mail a floppy and a self-addressed return envelope to me at my home. I was inundated with floppies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBEdit has been around for a lifetime by software standards. How have you seen the user base change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our base started as Mac software developers, scientists, system administrators, and other technical users. The first big change was popularity among HTML authors and web back-end developers. As word spread, we were able to help folks understand that the internet was built with text—that you could treat text as data or you could treat it as a document. So the next wave brought in internet architects, cryptanalysts, and scientists from unexpected disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third wave has been mostly writers and other content creators—folks who see their text not as data but as words, and who want as little as possible between them and their words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as many changes as we’ve seen, there has been a delightful constancy to our customers: They’re people who simply want to get work done. They’re not distracted by shiny things in their software tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the more surprising projects you’ve seen people create with BBEdit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been so much! Our customers have used BBEdit to create novels, doctoral theses, and other long written works. One customer has used BBEdit as part of the development workflow to fly UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] the size of an F-16; the flight control system sends data to BBEdit in real time, where the engineers examine it, change it, and send it back to the aircraft in just a few seconds. And the Human Genome Project even uses BBEdit to help analyze long sequences of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C3DDA113-1489-486E-AF99-0657F57C7B2B/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;Version 3.0 of BBEdit, “accelerated for Power Macintosh,” from 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the software evolved over the years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBEdit has undergone one huge technical transformation after another. First there was the port to PowerPC. We developed an OpenDoc component, and some of the internal architecture work we did for that is still in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came a nearly complete rewrite of its internal architecture, followed closely by a port to Mac OS X—BBEdit was the first third-party application to run natively on that new OS—and then the port to Intel. Last year we finished rewriting BBEdit again, this time as an AppKit application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between PowerPC and OpenDoc, there was another development: the emergence of the World Wide Web. BBEdit had a plug-in model at the time, and two of our customers—one in the UK and one in Spain—independently wrote HTML markup tools. This was 1995, and we had no idea what HTML was, but we could tell that it was going somewhere. So we evaluated the tools, chose a set of them to bundle with BBEdit, and off we went. Little did we know...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBEdit is one of the most beloved apps out there. Why do you think that is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve always had the utmost respect for the user. Every internal decision about look and function answers the questions “What does the customer need?” and “How can we help them be more productive?” (Not “How can we give them what they’re asking for?” because that isn’t the right question to answer.) The Macintosh was introduced to help anybody do great things. It’s something we believe in completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on the Mac App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;ARKit 3.5 takes advantage of the new LiDAR Scanner and depth-sensing system on iPad&amp;nbsp;Pro to support a new generation of AR apps that use Scene Geometry for enhanced scene understanding and object occlusion. And now, AR experiences on iPad Pro are even better with instant AR placement, and improved Motion Capture and People Occlusion — all without the need to write any new code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/"&gt;Learn more about &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;ARKit 3.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>How to debug your SwiftUI previews in Xcode</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8vkqn3ih</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8vkqn3ih</guid>
<description>&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/76AFFD7A-ACC8-4FA4-B63B-26EEE2510BEC/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With SwiftUI and Xcode 11, it’s much faster to create great user interfaces for apps on iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. As you write your app, use Xcode‘s design tools at any point to see live previews of your app in different states and on different compatible devices — all without launching Simulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s a valuable tip: We’re going to break down how you can debug that SwiftUI code live in Xcode, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enable Debug Preview in Xcode 11&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When creating an interface for your app in SwiftUI, you‘ll see a preview inside Xcode that displays your app, formatted for your currently-selected device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re hitting an issue in your code, however, and don’t know where to troubleshoot, you can instead enable Debug Preview to quickly find that pesky bug. Here’s how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your Swift project in Xcode 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click (or Control-click) on the Live Preview button in the bottom right corner of the preview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Debug Preview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class="inline-article-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/954E17C3-FA6F-4FA5-A502-E3B0AA10B9A6/1024.jpeg" data-hires="false"&gt;&lt;p class="typography-caption"&gt;The Debug Preview mode in Xcode provides easy access to an assortment of debugging tools for your app, including a visual breakdown of your app’s elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you can troubleshoot your SwiftUI project using all of the usual debugging tools, such as breakpoints, view debugging, memory graph debugging, and logging to the Console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/"&gt;Learn more &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;about SwiftUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/"&gt;Check out Apple’s &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;SwiftUI Tutorials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/233"&gt;Check out Mastering &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;SwiftUI Previews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>The App Store is Expanding to New Countries</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03232020a</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03232020a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the creativity and innovation of developers like you, the App&amp;nbsp;Store has become much more than the world’s safest marketplace. It’s grown into a vibrant platform with great apps that influence culture and change lives, with over half a billion visitors each week. This wide-reaching platform has helped generate over $155 billion in developer earnings — just from sales of apps and in-app purchases. Today, the App&amp;nbsp;Store gives you the opportunity to connect with users in 155 countries or regions. We’re pleased to announce that the App&amp;nbsp;Store will expand even farther this year with upcoming support for 20 new countries, allowing you to increase your impact and grow your business in new markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To allow your app to appear in these new countries, your membership Account&amp;nbsp;Holder first needs to accept the updated Program License Agreement by signing in to their account on the Apple&amp;nbsp;Developer website. If you have a Paid Applications Agreement, the Account&amp;nbsp;Holder will also need to accept this updated agreement in App&amp;nbsp;Store&amp;nbsp;Connect. You can then select the “New Countries or Regions” checkbox in the Pricing and Availability section of your app information page to automatically make your app available in all new countries. Completing these steps by April 10, 2020 will help make sure your app is ready to be published as content initially becomes available across new locations. We’ll let you know when you can choose from specific new countries and update the default subscription pricing for these locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/"&gt;View &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;your account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Ensuring the Credibility of Health &amp;amp; Safety Information  </title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03142020a</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03142020a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The App&amp;nbsp;Store should always be a safe and trusted place for users to download apps. Now more than ever that commitment takes on special significance as the world fights the COVID-19 pandemic. Communities around the world are depending on apps to be credible news sources — helping users understand the latest health innovations, find out where they can get help if needed or provide assistance to their neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help fulfill these expectations, we're evaluating apps critically to ensure data sources are reputable and that developers presenting these apps are from recognized entities such as government organizations, health-focused NGOs, companies deeply credentialed in health issues, and medical or educational institutions. Only developers from one of these recognized entities should submit an app related to COVID-19. Entertainment or game apps with COVID-19 as their theme will not be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand the need to get these apps into the hands of customers as soon as possible. We encourage developers that meet this criteria to select &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;“Time-Sensitive Event”&lt;/span&gt; on the expedite request form to ensure prioritized review since App&amp;nbsp;Store review may take longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are developing an app on behalf of a client, please advise your client to add you to the development team of their Apple Developer account. If your client does not yet have an Apple Developer account, they can enroll in the &lt;a href="/programs/"&gt;Apple Developer Program&lt;/a&gt;. Nonprofit organizations, accredited educational institutions, and government entities that plan to distribute only free apps on the App&amp;nbsp;Store can request to have their annual membership fee waived, if based in an eligible country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/support/membership-fee-waiver/"&gt;Learn about membership fee waivers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/app-store/review/guidelines/"&gt;Read the App&amp;nbsp;Store Review Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/contact/app-store/?topic=expedite"&gt;Request an expedited review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Updates to Universal Purchase and App&amp;nbsp;Store&amp;nbsp;Categories</title>

<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=02052020a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Starting in March 2020, you’ll be able to distribute iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS versions of your app as a universal purchase, allowing customers to enjoy your app and in&amp;#8209;app purchases across platforms by purchasing only once.

Get started by building and testing your apps using a single bundle ID with Xcode 11.4 beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, categories will be unified across the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/span&gt; to align with this change, and to help make your apps more discoverable. The following changes will be made.&lt;ul class="list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;You’ll be able to select the following categories for iOS apps: “Developer Tools” and “Graphics &amp;amp; Design”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You’ll be able to select the following categories for macOS apps: “Books”, “Food &amp;amp; Drink”, “Magazines &amp;amp; Newspapers”, “Navigation”, and “Shopping”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The “Photography” and “Video” categories on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/span&gt; will be combined into “Photo &amp;amp; Video”. Mac apps and pending updates with the “Photography” or “Video” category selected in &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store Connect&lt;/span&gt; will be moved automatically to the combined category.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Kids” will no longer be a subcategory within “Games” on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;Mac App Store.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, you can change the categories and subcategories associated with your app at any time with an app update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/download"&gt;Download Xcode &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;11.4 beta &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#dev97865727c"&gt;Learn how to edit app information &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;in App Store Connect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>App Updates for HTML5&amp;nbsp;Apps</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=01212020a</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=01212020a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; Review Guidelines are designed to help developers create apps that are secure, high-quality, reliable, and that respect user privacy. In order to ensure this, we’ve always specified that all apps be self-contained bundles. This means that the core features and functionality of the app must be contained within the software’s binary, rather than made possible by referring users outside of the approved app — including through the use of HTML5. Apps that dynamically provide core features and functionality with web technology like HTML5 are best delivered through Safari, rather than through the curated &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/app-store/review/guidelines/#third-party-software"&gt;Guideline 4.7 sections 4, 5, and&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/a&gt; were updated in June 2019 to further clarify that apps containing or running code that is not embedded in the binary cannot provide access to real money gaming, lotteries, or charitable donations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, existing apps must be in full compliance with these guidelines by March&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>App Updates in the Kids&amp;nbsp;Category</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;When parents visit the Kids category on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store,&lt;/span&gt; they expect that the apps they find are suitable for children. That’s why apps published on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; must protect children’s data and provide only age-appropriate content. Apps must also require a parental gate in order to link out of the app, request permissions, or present purchasing opportunities. It’s critical that apps do not transmit personally identifiable information or device information to third parties, and that advertisements are human-reviewed for age appropriateness in order to be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, existing apps in the Kids category on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; must be in full compliance with the updated &lt;a href="/app-store/review/guidelines/#kids-category"&gt;guideline 1.3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/app-store/review/guidelines/#kids"&gt;guideline 5.1.4&lt;/a&gt;  by March&amp;nbsp;3, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a href="/app-store/kids-apps/"&gt;Learn about building apps &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;for kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Using Auto-Renewable Subscriptions</title>

At the end of each subscription duration, the subscription automatically renews until a user chooses to cancel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great subscription apps justify the recurring payment by providing ongoing value to users and continually innovating the app experience. If you’re considering implementing the subscription model, here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions?cid=developer80#offering-subscriptions"&gt;&lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;Learn more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions?cid=developer80#attracting-subscribers"&gt;Learn more about &lt;span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap"&gt;attracting subscribers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Upcoming Price and Tax Changes in Pakistan, Thailand, and&amp;nbsp;Singapore</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=01162020a</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=01162020a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When taxes or foreign exchange rates change, we sometimes need to update prices on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store.&lt;/span&gt; In the next few days, prices of apps on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; and in-app purchases (excluding auto-renewable subscriptions) will change in the following countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thailand: Prices will decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pakistan: Prices will increase due to changes in foreign exchange rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, on January 1, 2020, a 7% goods and services tax (GST) was introduced in Singapore. Developers based in Singapore who provide their GST number in &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store Connect&lt;/span&gt; will not have their proceeds affected. Otherwise, proceeds will be adjusted accordingly. Prices on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; won’t change based on the introduction of this tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once these changes go into effect, the Pricing and Availability section of My Apps will be updated. You can change the price of your apps and in-app purchases (including auto-renewable subscriptions) at any time in &lt;a href="/app-store-connect/"&gt;App&amp;nbsp;Store&amp;nbsp;Connect&lt;/a&gt;. For subscriptions, you have the option to preserve prices for existing subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="https://itunespartner.apple.com/assets/downloads/011020-Apps-Pricing-Thailand-Pakistan.pdf"&gt;View the updated price tier charts now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Building Adaptive User Interfaces for iPhone and&amp;nbsp;iPad</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=01132020b</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=01132020b</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Apps should look great on all models of iPhone and iPad, regardless of display size or aspect ratio. With features like Xcode storyboards and Auto Layout, your app’s interface elements and layouts automatically fit the display. As announced at WWDC19, starting April 2020, apps submitted to the App Store must use an Xcode storyboard to provide the app’s launch screen and must have an interface that supports any display size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for Multitasking on iPad is strongly encouraged. Adding support for multiple windows, and adopting Multitasking capabilities, including Slide Over, Split View, and Picture in Picture, will ensure your app delivers a modern and complete experience on iPadOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/"&gt;Learn about designing adaptive interfaces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/system-capabilities/multitasking/"&gt;Learn about multitasking on iPad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Updating Apps that Use Web&amp;nbsp;Views</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12232019b</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12232019b</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If your app still embeds web content using the deprecated UIWebView API, we strongly encourage you to update to WKWebView as soon as possible for improved security and reliability. WKWebView ensures that compromised web content doesn’t affect the rest of an app by limiting web processing to the app’s web view. And it’s supported in iOS and macOS, and by Mac&amp;nbsp;Catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The App Store will no longer accept new apps using UIWebView as of April 2020 and app updates using UIWebView as of December 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/"&gt;Learn more about WKWebView&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Update to Notarization Prerequisites</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12232019a</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12232019a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In June, we announced that all Mac software distributed outside the Mac App Store must be notarized by Apple in order to run by default on macOS&amp;nbsp;Catalina. In September, we temporarily adjusted the &lt;a href="/news/?id=09032019a"&gt;notarization prerequisites&lt;/a&gt; to make this transition easier and to protect users on macOS&amp;nbsp;Catalina who continue to use older versions of software. Starting February 3, 2020, all submitted software must meet the original notarization prerequisites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t yet done so, upload your software to the notary service and review the developer log for warnings. These warnings will become errors starting February 3 and must be fixed in order to have your software notarized. Software notarized before February 3 will continue to run by default on macOS&amp;nbsp;Catalina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, all installer packages must be signed since they may contain executable code. Disk images do not need to be signed, although signing them can help your users verify their contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/developer-id/"&gt;Learn about notarizing software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Apple Joins New Smart Home Initiative</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12182019a</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12182019a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple is taking a major step in its approach to the smart home by joining a new industry effort with Amazon, Google, Zigbee Alliance, and others. The initiative aims to develop an open standard that will increase the compatibility of smart home products across multiple platforms, with security and privacy as fundamental design tenets. The new standard will make it even simpler for developers to build one device that is compatible with smart home services and voice assistants, while ensuring consumers can easily choose smart home products that seamlessly work together.&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/homekit/whats-new/"&gt;Learn more about the initiative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>New Server Notifications for Subscriptions Now Available </title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=11222019a</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=11222019a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Server-to-server notifications from the App Store let you receive real-time updates in a subscription’s status, so you can provide customized experiences for your subscribers. New notifications are now available when a subscription renewal fails due to a billing issue and when a billing issue is resolved by the App Store. In addition, a unified receipt containing information about the latest 100 in-app purchase transactions is now included with the notification. If you’ve already enabled server-to-server notifications in App Store Connect, you’ll automatically receive the new notifications and unified receipt for these subscription events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreservernotifications/"&gt;Learn how to enable server-to-server notifications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And if you need a symbol that isn’t provided by SF&amp;nbsp;Symbols, you can export template files to create your own with the same capabilities using a vector graphics editor.  Version&amp;nbsp;1.1 adds custom symbol validation, a new sidebar with categories for faster browsing, and the option to receive updates automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/"&gt;Learn more about SF Symbols&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-downloadcircle" href="/design/resources/"&gt;Download SF Symbols&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The local age rating is shown as a badge displayed alongside Apple’s rating on the App Store in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps with Infrequent/Mild selected for the following content descriptions displays a local rating of 12+:&lt;ul class="no-margin-top"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mature or Suggestive Themes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sexual Content or Nudity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps with Infrequent/Mild selected for the following content descriptions displays a local rating of 14+:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="no-margin-top"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Alcohol, Tobacco, or Drug Use References&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps with Frequent/Intense selected for the following content descriptions displays a local rating of 18+:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="no-margin-top"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mature or Suggestive Themes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Realistic Violence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sexual Content or Nudity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simulated Gambling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev269f11291"&gt;Learn more about age ratings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;When taxes or foreign exchange rates change, we sometimes need to update prices on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store.&lt;/span&gt; Starting October 2019, the Japan Consumption Tax (JCT) will increase from 8% to 10%, resulting in a price increase for apps on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; and in-app purchases (excluding auto-renewable subscriptions) in Japan. Once the change goes into effect, the Pricing and Availability section of My Apps will be updated and your proceeds will be increased accordingly. You can change the price of your apps and in-app purchases (including auto-renewable subscriptions) at any time in &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store Connect.&lt;/span&gt; For subscriptions, you have the option to preserve prices for existing subscribers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that Apple does not administer the collection and remittance of JCT applicable to sales to customers purchasing content on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; in Japan. You will continue to be responsible for the collection and remittance of such taxes to the appropriate tax authorities, as may be required by local law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="https://itunespartner.apple.com/assets/downloads/180919Japan.pdf"&gt;View updated price tiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;A new certificate for server-based &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;Game Center&lt;/span&gt; verification is available via the publicKeyUrl property of &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gklocalplayer/1515407-generateidentityverificationsign"&gt;generateIdentityVerificationSignature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The previous certificate will no longer be available as of September 17, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure your app always retrieves and uses the current publicKeyUrl value so it automatically uses the new certificate. If your app caches the certificate or hardcodes the certificate URL, it will require an update. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/381711"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Introducing Billing Grace Period for Subscriptions</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09122019c</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09122019c</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve worked closely with leading developers to create a solution for reducing customer churn while improving the experience for auto-renewable subscriptions. With the new grace period for unsuccessful auto-renewals, subscribers can continue accessing your app’s paid content while Apple attempts to collect payment — allowing them time to fix the issue. There won’t be any interruption to the subscriber’s days of paid service or to your revenue if payment is successful within the grace period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/app-store-connect/whats-new/?id=billinggraceperiod"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>New Guidelines for Sign in with Apple</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09122019b</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09122019b</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Make it easy for users to sign in to your apps and websites using the Apple&amp;nbsp;ID they already have. With privacy and security features built-in, &lt;a href="/sign-in-with-apple/"&gt;Sign in with Apple&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to help users set up an account, sign in, and engage with your app quickly and easily. All accounts are protected with two-factor authentication for superior security, and Apple will not track users’ activity in your app or website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve updated the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; Review Guidelines to provide criteria for when apps are required to use Sign&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;Apple. Starting today, new apps submitted to the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; must follow these guidelines. Existing apps and app updates must follow them by April&amp;nbsp;2020. We’ve also provided new guidelines for using Sign in with Apple on the web and other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/app-store/review/guidelines/#sign-in-with-apple"&gt;View the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; review guideline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/sign-in-with-apple/usage-guidelines-for-websites-and-other-platforms/"&gt;View guidelines for websites and other platforms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>App Updates in the Kids Category</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=091202019a</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=091202019a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When parents visit the Kids category on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store,&lt;/span&gt; they expect the apps they find will protect their children’s data, provide only age-appropriate content, and require a parental gate in order to link out of the app, request permissions, or present purchasing opportunities. It’s critical that no personally identifiable information or device information be transmitted to third parties, and that advertisements are human-reviewed for age appropriateness in order to be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/app-store/review/guidelines/#kids-category"&gt;Guideline 1.3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/app-store/review/guidelines/#kids"&gt;guideline 5.1.4&lt;/a&gt; detail important rules related to apps in the Kids category and we’ve been working with some developers of existing apps to assist them in the transition to full compliance with this important guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All new apps must follow these guidelines, and we urge you to update your existing apps as soon as possible. If your existing app requires more time to implement these guidelines, we’ve provided an additional six months, until March 3, 2020, to bring it into full compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;</description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;With watchOS 6, customers around the world can use the new &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; on Apple Watch to easily discover, browse, search, and install apps directly on their wrist. And for the first time, you can distribute an app just for Apple Watch, without a companion app on iOS. Build your watchOS apps using Xcode 11 &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;GM seed,&lt;/span&gt; test them on devices running the latest watchOS 6 GM seed, and submit them for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting April 2020, all new watchOS apps and app updates submitted to the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; must be built with the watchOS 6 SDK and support Apple Watch Series&amp;nbsp;4 or later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/watchos/submit/"&gt;Learn about preparing your apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>App Updates for HTML5 Apps</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09062019b</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09062019b</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In order to provide users with the secure and curated experience that they expect on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store,&lt;/span&gt; we have always specified that apps must be self-contained bundles. This means that the core features and functionality of the app must be contained within the binary of the software, rather than made possible by referring users outside of the approved app, including through the use of HTML5. Apps that provide core features and functionality dynamically with web technology like HTML5 are best delivered to everyone in Safari, rather than through the curated &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent fraud and abuse, the exceptions to this rule have always been very narrow. In June, we updated &lt;a href="/app-store/review/guidelines/#third-party-software"&gt;guideline 4.7 sections 4, 5, &amp; 6&lt;/a&gt;, to further narrow these exceptions and clarify an existing restriction. Apps containing or running code that is not embedded in the binary cannot provide access to real money gaming, lotteries, or charitable donations, among other changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All new apps must follow this guideline and we urge you to update your existing apps as soon as possible. If your existing app requires more time to implement the guidelines, we’ve provided an additional six months, until March 3, 2020, to bring it into compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/app-store/review/guidelines/"&gt;View the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; Review Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Submitting a Capability Request for Apps Using MDM</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09062019a</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09062019a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Mobile Device Management (MDM) is a powerful and wide-reaching technology that grants a broad range of access to and control over users’ devices. While these capabilities are necessary to effectively manage a large number of devices, and in limited cases for parental control services, they also have the potential to create user privacy and security issues if not used properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, we announced that apps seeking to include MDM technology must first submit an MDM capability request. This process will evaluate how the app will use MDM in order to prevent abuse and ensure that no data is shared with third parties. The MDM capability will be re-evaluated on an annual basis, and you will need to submit a new request each year. We have worked with developers of parental control apps who have successfully completed this process and are now providing safer apps for kids and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new guideline was effective for all apps on June 3, 2019. If you already have an app on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; that uses MDM capabilities but does not follow the new guideline, &lt;a href="/contact/request/mdm-capability"&gt;submit an MDM capability&lt;/a&gt; request as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="/app-store/review/guidelines/#mobile-device-management"&gt;View the Mobile Device Management guideline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Notarizing Your Mac Software for macOS&amp;nbsp;Catalina</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, Mac software distributed outside the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/span&gt; must be notarized by Apple in order to run on &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;macOS Catalina.&lt;/span&gt; To make this transition easier and to protect users on &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;macOS Catalina&lt;/span&gt; who continue to use older versions of software, we’ve adjusted the notarization prerequisites until January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now notarize Mac software that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn’t have the Hardened Runtime capability enabled.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has components not signed with your Developer ID.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn’t include a secure timestamp with your code-signing signature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was built with an older SDK.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes the com.apple.security.get-task-allow entitlement with the value set to any variation of true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to submit all versions of your software. While Xcode 10 or later is still required to submit, you don’t need to rebuild or re-sign your software before submission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/" class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" target="_blank"&gt;Learn more about Developer ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Get Ready for Dark Mode</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=0829019a</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=0829019a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Dark Mode introduces a dramatic new look for iPhone and iPad that is seamlessly integrated throughout the system and simple to turn on from Control Center or Siri. With a dark appearance for all user interface elements, your app’s content becomes the focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a user has Dark Mode turned on, all apps built with the iOS&amp;nbsp;13 SDK will run in Dark&amp;nbsp;Mode. Learn how to optimize for Dark Mode, then test your apps on a device running the latest beta version of iOS&amp;nbsp;13 or iPadOS. If you need more time to make your apps look fantastic in Dark Mode, or if Dark Mode is not suited for your app, you can learn how to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-playcircle" href="/videos/wwdc2019/?q=dark%20mode"&gt;View WWDC19 videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/supporting_dark_mode_in_your_interface/"&gt;Read documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Upcoming Changes for 17+ Age Ratings and App Availability</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=08192019a</link>
<guid>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=08192019a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In an effort to open up additional opportunities for developers, we’ve worked with the government of the Republic of Korea on making more apps available on the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; in the Republic of Korea. And to ensure that our global age rating system continues to help make the &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;App Store&lt;/span&gt; safe for kids, apps that feature Frequent/Intense Simulated Gambling will be rated 17+ in all countries and regions starting August 20, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your app meets at least one of the criteria below, you’ll be able to offer it on the App&amp;nbsp;Store in the Republic of Korea to users 19 years of age or older. You’ll need to enter a Rating Classification Number from the Game Rating and Administration Committee in App&amp;nbsp;Store Connect, and can do so starting August 20. Apps with a number entered at this time will be published later this week. If you don’t have a Rating Classification Number, you can &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/english/" target="_blank"&gt;apply for one now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apps in the Casino subcategory with age rating 17+&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apps in the Games or Entertainment categories with Frequent/Intense selected for at least one of the following content descriptions:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul class="list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simulated Gambling &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sexual Content or Nudity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alcohol, Tobacco, or Drug Use or Reference&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Realistic Violence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enter your Rating Classification Number:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sign in to &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a href="https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/" target="_blank"&gt;App Store Connect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go to My Apps and select your app from the list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the App Information section under Availability in the Republic of Korea, enter your Rating Classification Number.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Submit your app for review.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>
